In a historic first, Hillary Clinton was named the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee in the upcoming U.S. elections. If she wins, she will join Theresa May of Britain and Angela Merkel of Germany in the ranks of women who lead prominent Western democracies. They're not alone, either. In recent years, the number of women holding positions in both parliament and executive government has grown. As of June 2016, women\u2019s membership in parliament doubled from 11.3 percent in 1995 to 22.1 percent in 2015, according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/pdf/publications/WIP20Y-en.pdf\">study</a> by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. And this year alone, there have been many historic firsts. In Iran, women won 17 seats during the Islamic Republic\u2019s parliamentary elections in February. \u201cThis is a record and we are happy that our dear women are taking part in all stages, especially in politics,\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani <a href=\"http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2016/may/27/iran%E2%80%99s-runoff-election-parliament\">said</a> in a speech back in May. Africa has had some of the most dramatic breakthroughs over the past 20 years. As of June, four African nations were part of the top 10 as far as the number of women represented in parliament. Rwanda, for example, tops the chart as the country with the highest number of women represented in parliament in both the lower (63.8 percent) and upper houses (38.5 percent) in 2016. But women remain a relatively small group in parliaments around the world, and progress is slow. Data from the IPU shows that in a vast majority of countries, men still dominate the political stage. In both the lower and upper houses combined, women around the world account for around 22 percent of seats held in parliament. \"Yes it is an improvement considering that it started at a low base,\" Executive Director of U.N. Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka said. \"But if we continue at this pace, it's going to take us too long. We need to fast-track the attainment of gender equality.\" The U.S. is one country that lags the global average of women in the national legislature. It ranks behind 95 countries, including low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, El Salvador and Suriname. Other countries that outperform the United States include Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. One way that countries have been fast-tracking female participation in politics is through gender quotas, and the results have left many surprised. Countries that that have relatively low socioeconomic development or have just emerged from conflict, such as Afghanistan, Tanzania and Ecuador, have shown tremendous improvement and have higher levels of female representation in parliaments. Jennifer Rosen, assistant professor of sociology at Pepperdine University, says emerging democracies give leaders a unique opportunity for leaders to enshrine gender quotas in their new constitutions, helping bypass cultural barriers that would have otherwise stood in the way of women participating in politics for many years. Different electoral systems also influence women's participation in parliament. While scholars agree that proportional representation systems, which allow people to vote for a party list rather than a particular candidate, have a positive influence on female representation in government, some are divided as to whether it has a positive impact on all countries or only on Western democracies. One way for countries to shift their mentalities is to encourage people in executive leadership positions to set an example, Rosen said. Ngcuka, the U.N. women executive director, agrees and said men play an important role and that women shouldn't be the only ones trying to \"move the glass ceiling,\" noting how attitudes change when influential leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominated a cabinet in 2015 that was half-female. Political parties that are supposed to provide gender quotas need to ensure that they place women in winnable positions, IPU Secretary General Martin Chungong said. \"In many instances they are not walking the walk,\" he said. \"It's not enough to have quotas. We need to provide incentives for people who don't want to implement them.\" What's also clear is that having women in national legislatures can change the way a country is governed. Research shows that when women participate in politics, the conversation gets steered toward issues that their male counterparts often <a href=\"https://www.inclusivesecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bringing-Women-into-Government_FINAL.pdf\">fail </a>to address, such as family planning, education and gender-based violence. \"We have seen that there are certain issues women are better able to articulate,\" Chungong said. \"Women tend to take leading roles not because it is a women's issue, but because it has to do with livelihood of society as a whole.\"   <strong>More on WorldViews</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/13/the-world-is-getting-better-at-paid-maternity-leave-the-u-s-is-not/\">The world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

The noise was the sound of large teeth scraping against his skull, he <a href=\"http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/boulder/bear-attacks-camper-at-glacier-view-ranch-christian-retreat-northwest-of-boulder\">told Denver ABC-affiliate KMGH</a>. A black bear, the teen realized, was trying to pull him out of his sleeping bag by his head. \u201cIt grabbed me like this and pulled me, and then it bit the back of my head and dragged me,\u201d the teen, identified only by his first name, Dylan, told KMGH. \u201cWhen it was dragging me, that was the slowest part. It felt like it went forever.\u201d Fellow staffers and campers were roused by the commotion and tried to scare the bear away as Dylan fought back. The bear dragged Dylan about 10 feet, then dropped him and walked away. Dylan was taken to the hospital. His injuries weren\u2019t life threatening. Authorities are searching for the bear, which will likely be euthanized, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/teen-bit-in-head-by-bear-wakes-up-to-crunching-sound/2017/07/09/5f2e5146-64e7-11e7-94ab-5b1f0ff459df_story.html?utm_term=.28f7c3a6a00f\">according to the Associated Press</a>. The teen is a counselor at Glacier View Ranch, a camp owned by the Rocky Mountain Conference of Seventh Day Adventists, the AP reported. <a href=\"http://www.rmcsda.org/camp\">According to the camp\u2019s website</a>, the conference hosts seven weeks of summer camps for youth ages 7 to 18. The camps feature zip lines, go-carts and canoeing, \u201call in a safe, Christ-centered atmosphere.\u201d The ranch confirmed the attack on its website, and said it would not cancel the rest of the summer\u2019s camps. About 100 children and teens are expected to attend. Campers that Dylan was supervising over the weekend had asked if they could spend the night under the stars, sleeping by the camp\u2019s lake. Dylan relented. He told reporters he teaches wilderness survival at the camp. How fortuitous. One of the tips experts recommend for surviving a bear attack is to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/23/how-to-best-survive-a-black-bear-attack/?utm_term=.21f8a3d65f8a\">fight back</a>. Dylan\u2019s experience follows other troubling reports of bear attacks, including two fatal maulings in Alaska a day apart last month. On June 18, Patrick \u201cJack\u201d Cooper, a 16-year-old from Anchorage, was killed by a bear after he veered off a trail during a mountain foot race south of the city, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/energy-environment/more-alaskans-mauled-by-bears-in-alaska/2017/06/26/84d148e8-5abc-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_story.html?utm_term=.51454ad43893\">according to the AP</a>. A day later, Erin Johns, a 27-year-old contract worker for Pogo Mine died in a mauling 275 miles northeast of Anchorage. Her 38-year-old co-worker was also injured. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/energy-environment/more-alaskans-mauled-by-bears-in-alaska/2017/06/26/84d148e8-5abc-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_story.html?utm_term=.51454ad43893\">Authorities told the AP</a> they were baffled by the uptick in bear attacks, although the numbers can fluctuate from year to year. Dylan said his experience hasn\u2019t changed his attitude toward bears. In fact, he was back at camp \u2014 sporting fresh scars \u2014 when he talked to reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the bears. I\u2019m not afraid of sleeping outside anymore.

In New York, counterterrorism resources were deployed to transit hotspots across the city. The New York Police Department said teams were sent to crowded areas and transit stops \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d \u201cAt this time, there is no known indication that the attack has any nexus to New York City. We will continue to follow the situation in Belgium closely with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI and adjust the department\u2019s deployments accordingly,\u201d police spokesman Stephen P. Davis said in a statement. The United States Department of Homeland Security did not heighten its federal threat level, but advised the public to report suspicious activity. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/03/22/statement-secretary-jeh-c-johnson-attacks-today-brussels-belgium\">said in a statement</a> that \u201cadditional security\u201d would be deployed at major city airports and rail and transit stations across the country. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) directed state officials to step up patrols at heavily traveled locations around the state, including bridges, tunnels, airports and mass transit systems, he said. \u201cPublic safety is paramount, and I want the people of this state to know that we are working with all local and federal partners, remaining vigilant and taking all necessary measures to keep New Yorkers safe,\u201d he said in a statement. At JFK International Airport, New York National Guard forces were providing additional security detail. The Guard deployed 400 service members across the New York City area Tuesday, Cuomo said. They focused increased patrols on transportation hubs such as JFK and LaGuardia Airports. In addition, New York State Troopers were monitoring Penn Station and Grand Central Station as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stepped up its police presence at airports, bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center complex, Cuomo said. And the Metropolitan Transit Auhtority was upping patrols across the system. In Washington, Metro Transit Police advised passengers to remain vigilant. The agency said it would conduct additional K9 sweeps and patrols across the system Tuesday morning as a precaution, but that no \u201cknown, specific or credible threat\u201d existed. Alexandria Deputy Police Chief Shahram Fard said in a Tweet that Alexandria Police patrol officers were assisting Metro Transit Police in monitoring Metro parking lots, and it was expected that agencies across the region would aid in the security effort. Internationally, the attacks led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights \u2014 mostly in and out of Brussels Airport \u2014 which closed Tuesday. Brussels Airlines had cancelled 203 flights by Tuesday afternoon, according to the Flight tracking website flightaware.com. On U.S. airlines, the site said, flights with Brussels on their itinerary were canceled. They included: A United Airlines flight bound for Dulles International Airport that was scheduled to leave Brussels at 7:10 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, along with three other United flights; six Delta Airlines flights and two American Airlines flights \u2014 one bound for Philadelphia and another departing from there for the Belgian capital. American Airlines spokesman Kent Powell said the airline has made accommodations for passengers with reservations to Brussels, and arrangements would be made for those who remain in Belgium. Flights to and from Brussels were canceled through Thursday, he said. American\u2019s next flight to Brussels is scheduled to depart Philadelphia on Friday evening, while its next flight from Brussels back to the U.S. is scheduled to leave the Belgian capital at 9:40 Saturday morning. \u201cAmerican Airlines is taking care of our employees and customers in Brussels after this morning\u2019s events. At this time, there are no reported injuries to our employees. American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAmerican Airlines flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia has been canceled for today. When operations at the Brussels airport resume, we will reaccommodate our customers. We have issued a travel policy for customers with reservations to Brussels who wish to change their itineraries.\u201d <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority did not outline specific steps that were being taken at the region\u2019s two major airports, Dulles International and Reagan National airports, but a statement reinforced the airports\u2019 commitment to passenger safety. The statement encouraged passengers to stay vigilant and report any unusual activity.</span> \u201cReagan National and Dulles International airports have a robust security structure, both publicly visible and behind the scenes,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe constantly train our employees and evaluate our security procedures, in collaboration with our federal partners and local mutual aid partners, to make adjustments, updates and enhancements based on new information and situations.\u201d Officials at Baltimore Washington International Airport said they were \u201cworking closely\u201d with federal and state law enforcement agencies after the Brussels attacks, but that no specific threat existed. Maryland officials said Tuesday that travelers should expect to see more police and canine explosive detection patrols throughout the state\u2019s transportation network. In Chicago, extra officers and canine units were dispatched to the airports and Chicago Transit Authority stations stations as a precaution, the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-brussels-security-chicago-20160322-story.html\">Chicago Tribune reported</a>. A police spokesman told the paper that the interim police superintendent has ordered \u201cstepped-up presence at airports and transportation sites within Chicago.\u201d In Los Angeles, the county sheriff\u2019s transit police swept Union Station, the downtown train station, and heightened security at other transit hubs, according to the Los Angeles Times. Security would be increased at several of the city\u2019s major metro stations, a spokesman told the paper. At Los Angeles International Airport, officers would be making their presence known more than usual, an airport police officer <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-los-angeles-security-lax-metro-response-20160322-story.html\">told the paper</a>. And in San Francisco, there would be an increased uniform police presence at \u201ckey locations\u201d across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, said spokeswoman Alicia Trost.

The World Wildlife Fund says surveys indicate that 3,890 tigers now live in 13 countries across Asia, up from an estimated 3,200 in 2010, when the last wide-scale counts were carried out. Increases were particularly notable in Russia, Nepal, Bhutan and India, which is home to the world\u2019s largest wild tiger population. WWF attributed the rise to better surveys, which are carried out by tiger-range countries and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as enhanced protection efforts in the six years since those nations pledged to double the population by 2022. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched tigers decline for decades and have dreamed of bending that curve in the other direction,\u201d said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \u201cThis is a big deal.\u201d There are some caveats, of course. The current tiger population is bigger than it was six years ago, but it\u2019s miniscule compared to the 100,000 believed to have lived in Asia in 1900, and it\u2019s still smaller than the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 captive tigers that call the United States home. Surveys remain poor in some countries, such as Malaysia. Last week, Cambodia announced that tigers were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/06/tigers-declared-extinct-in-cambodia\">now extinct</a> within its borders. And tigers are still prized, and killed, for the supposed medicinal value of their body parts. \u201cEvery part of the tiger \u2014 from whisker to tail \u2014 is traded in illegal wildlife markets, feeding a multibillion-dollar criminal network,\u201d WWF said in a statement.

My eyes hurt.\u201d But is it really the screen\u2019s fault? (And if so, is there any long- or short-term damage?) Would our eyes be any better off perusing printed pages all day? Yes, you can blame the screen, but not for everything. Some of the same eye-care advice you\u2019ll hear for computer screens apply to paper-bookworms, too. Screen-induced eye strain has an official name, if not a surprising one: <a href=\"http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome\">computer vision syndrome</a>. The term emerged about 20 years ago and describes a host of bothersome symptoms, including eye fatigue, burning and itchy eyes, blurred vision and sensitivity to bright light. People who spend two or more continuous hours at a computer every day are at greatest risk for developing the syndrome, according to the American Optometric Association. For most people, symptom treatment is enough \u2014 managing their reading position, taking rest breaks or using eye drops to relieve dry eyes. That said, dry and irritated eyes are associated with disorders of the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eye. See a doctor if you\u2019re putting drops in your eyes five or six times a day and still feel like they\u2019re dry, says James Salz, a University of Southern California eye doctor and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Still, he adds, \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that there\u2019s any long-term damage from reading on a screen.\u201d What is it about computers that irritates our eyes? The problem boils down to a couple of key factors: <b>Blinking.</b> Study after <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21480937\">study</a> has found that when reading on screens people tend to stare more than they do when reading on a printed page. More staring means less blinking, which means your eyes get less refreshment from tears. \u201cWhen you blink, you spread a layer of tears over the eye,\u201d says Mark Rosenfield, a professor at the State University of New York College of Optometry. With less blinking, eyes get dry and sore. Another difference between the printed page and the computer screen is where the words are positioned relative to the eyes. People generally look down while reading a book or newspaper, but staring at screen usually means staring straight ahead. When you look down, more of your eye is covered by the eyelid, but when you look straight ahead more of your eye is exposed to the drying effect of air. Coupled with reduced blinking, this leads to dry eyes. Reading on mobile devices may be more book-like in terms of positioning, but blink rate is still a concern. A small 2013 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873942/\">study </a>found that when reading print on paper or e-ink (the technology that attempts to replicate as closely as possible the printed page experience, Kindle paperwhite in this study), the subjects \u2014 12 men who read for at least an hour on each device \u2014 blinked more often when reading on paper or e-ink than they did when looking at an LCD screen (a tablet with its own light supply, the Kindle Fire here). Participants also reported more visual fatigue after reading on the LCD; fatigue rates on e-ink and paper were equivalent. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873942/\"> </a> <b>Distance</b>. Not surprisingly, people reading on their smartphones tend to hold the device much closer to their eyes than they would a book or magazine. In a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499163\">2011 study</a>, Rosenfield found that the 219 participants held their phones 14 inches from their eyes to read text messages and 12\u200a<sup class=\"frac\">1</sup> <span>/</span> <sub class=\"frac\">2 </sub>inches for a Web page. Typically, people read printed text from a distance of 15\u200a<sup class=\"frac\">3</sup> <span>/</span> <sub class=\"frac\">4 </sub>inches. The result is that \u201cyour eye has to work much harder to focus at close distances,\u201d Rosenfield says. The eyes turn in more (not quite cross-eyed) and that takes effort. Over time, that can lead to fatigue. Moreover, if you\u2019re of a certain age, that focusing effort becomes even harder. At about age 40, natural changes in the eye\u2019s focal length means most people can\u2019t see closely as well. That\u2019s when you start holding the restaurant menu at an arm\u2019s length to read. Other considerations are resolution, brightness, and glare, says Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University. \u201cThe resolution of print on paper is higher than any screen out there.\u201d Brightness should be adjusted for comfort, either on your screen or the lamp by your reading chair. As for glare, it is easier to read a book or an e-ink on an e-reader in the sunshine. But if you\u2019re reading late at night in bed, you might prefer the backlit screen of a tablet. The good thing about electronic reading is that you can change so many things to make the experience more comfortable, such as increasing the size of the text and fiddling with the brightness, which can also help you keep the words at a distance. Salz says 18 inches is ideal. Common sense goes a long way too, Salz says. \u201cAs soon as you feel fatigue, look away.\u201d Indeed, workplace advice for people who read on computers for a large part of their days, comes in the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. So good for us: A new excuse to gaze out the window.

These children are putting their fragile eyes at great risk. If a society is judged by how it protects the most vulnerable, we are failing our children. The masterminds of the new educational technology have linked arms with the self-promoting ambitious politicians who sit on boards of education at every level to create an unconscionable situation: our children are for sale, and their health is of no consequence to those who profit every day from the latest gizmos. Tech toys \u2014 from laptops to virtual reality gadgets \u2014 are promoted as tools to prepare our children for the future.

What this unholy alliance between schools and Ed Tech firms has kept extraordinarily quiet is the growing medical evidence that these devices can <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/25/digital-eye-strain/4491611/\">physically hurt our children</a>. If we don\u2019t protect them, this generation of children will pay the price: Their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-bad-for-your-eyes-are-computer-screens/2014/01/17/985b90cc-7c98-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html\">vision will be damaged</a>. Myopia \u2014 permanent nearsightedness \u2014 is reaching <a href=\"http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/\">epic proportions in this country and worldwide</a>. The cause? Screen time, according to the <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/91007/usc-eye-institute-study-seeks-cures-to-childhood-myopia/\">University of Southern California</a>, which has just completed the largest study ever done. Childhood myopia has doubled in the United States in the past 50 years, and experts have identified increased use of digital devices as the major culprit. Screen time brings blue light emissions as well. That can ruin young eyes because that nasty damaging ray goes right to the back of a child\u2019s eye, which doesn\u2019t have the ability to protect itself because of a lack of pigmentation. Because they are still growing, children\u2019s eyes are more vulnerable than adults\u2019. According to experts, the potential for early macular degeneration, which leads to blindness, is real. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/11/blue-light-from-tech-gadgets-and-digital-eye-strain-more-than-73-percent-of-young-adults-suffer-from-symptoms/\">blue light keeps children up at night</a>, too, by reducing melatonin. The tech companies know it. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a whole suite of new filters for sale. Another industry is born. Of course we want our kids to be fluent with technology and compete in a global economy, and of course their world will be dominated by screens, so their proficiency is mandatory. But schools need to live up to their duty of care to protect students; implementing safety precautions in the classroom is critical. Has anyone at your child\u2019s school warned you about potential dangers of using digital devices? Did your school send home any safety guidelines, even something as simple as \u201ctake frequent breaks and look away from the monitor\u201d? No, I didn\u2019t think so. Why aren\u2019t parents warned of the health risks posed by school equipment? It\u2019s an excellent question. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has protected office workers from many of the same computer-related health hazards since 1997, so it\u2019s no secret. Children are even more susceptible to injury, so why isn\u2019t anyone standing up to protect them? Where are the pediatricians? Haven\u2019t they noticed that many of our kids use screens every day at school? Why are they silent? Where are the children\u2019s eye doctors? Prescribing \u201ccomputer glasses\u201d is hardly the answer and leaves disadvantaged children disadvantaged, again. We can\u2019t wait for our children to start experiencing vision loss  and the dry eyes, blurry vision, headaches, neck/shoulder pain and sleeplessness associated with computer vision syndrome before action is taken. They are not lab rats whose injuries, a few years from now, will provide evidence-based support for safety requirements. Or are they? The Rules Committees in the Maryland House of Delegates needs to schedule hearings on a bill now before it that would mandate the creation of computer safety guidelines in Maryland classrooms, HB1524.  A hearing is scheduled on a <a href=\"http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=cmtepage&stab=03&id=ehe&tab=subject7&ys=2016RS\">Senate bill</a>, SB1150, on Wednesday. Lawmakers need to ensure that students are no longer sacrificial lambs to this craven educational alliance where everyone profits, while our children are damaged. "}], "saliency": []}

James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, received five felony counts, including smuggling migrants for financial gain resulting in death \u2014 a charge that could carry the death penalty. Other charges range from 10 to 20 years in federal prison, the Justice Department said in a release. Seven Mexicans and one Guatemalan were found dead in the trailer in San Antonio under stiflingly hot summer conditions, with as many as 200 people tightly packed and struggling to breathe through small holes. Two migrants later died in a hospital. Currently, two remain hospitalized, five were released to immigration authorities, and 22 are being held as material witnesses, according to the Justice Department. Some of the travelers had spent days held in a house near the border with Mexico. Some were told to pay hundreds of dollars to a group linked to Los Zetas, a deadly Mexican drug cartel, for safe passage across the Rio Grande in rafts, The Washington Post reported. Bradley initially told authorities he was unaware of the trailer\u2019s cargo and was surprised when he realized people had been trapped inside. He owned the truck found outside Walmart but not the trailer, according to public records. He told federal agents that the trailer\u2019s refrigeration system did not work and that the vent holes were probably clogged, according to the criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The truck\u2019s discovery revealed the group\u2019s horrifying journey to the United States at a time when immigration arrests have spiked under President Trump and illegal border crossings have plummeted, according to federal officials.

Their early inspection found \u201csevere electrical arcing damage\u201d to the rail and cables inside the tunnel. Metro is collecting information on radio testing being conducted throughout the system to present to a committee of fire chiefs that works with the regional government council, said Metro spokesman Dan Stessel. A meeting of that committee is set for this month, according to the letter to Warner. \u201cWe would like to see this meeting happen as soon as possible,\u201d Stessel said. Stessel also said Monday that Metro has resolved radio problems that affected coverage in parts of the Wheaton Station on the Red Line. Montgomery County Fire and Rescue had<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/in-montgomery-fire-officials-tests-radio-signals-from-metro-tunnels-dont-reach-the-road/2015/02/01/8312ac5c-aa3f-11e4-abe8-e1ef60ca26de_story.html\"> flagged the issue </a>to Metro Friday afternoon after its crews ran a routine test, according to a fire department e-mail. The problem involved a connector on a cable that carries signals from aboveground to the underground station. The problem at Wheaton was the only one found after testing at the county\u2019s 12 Metro stations, Stessel said. While a repair was pending, firefighters were reminded to communicate using a radio-relay system that positions them within sight of each other at key points between the tunnel and surface. Signal-relaying equipment is built into the subway and maintained by Metro. But regularly troubleshooting communication problems falls on Metro and each local jurisdiction. Although Metro and local jurisdictions test radio communications within the system, they do so independently of each other. Warner said he sees \u201ca real challenge\u201d more than a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and massive investments in emergency communications. \u201cYour system may be working but the handoff \u2014 the interoperability \u2014 is the place where so many things can go wrong,\u201d Warner said. Warner said the letter laid out a tentative timeline for making changes, but even the earliest actions would be two months off. Warner was part of the local congressional delegation given a limited briefing of events about the crisis. An early review found that District firefighters in the L\u2019Enfant Plaza tunnel had trouble communicating with commanders aboveground. Since then, Metro and the D.C. Fire Department have largely blamed each other for the communications problem. Their dispute centers on whether the District made technical changes to the way its radios work, when those changes were made, and what it told Metro about those changes in order for the rail system to make equipment adjustments in response. An e-mail released by the District as part of its review of the incident shows that firefighters flagged a radio problem to Metro in an e-mail on Jan. 8, four days before the incident at L\u2019Enfant Plaza. Metro officials said crew<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/metro-officials-clarify-communication-breakdown-during-lenfant-incident/2015/01/22/ad4a61d0-a252-11e4-903f-9f2faf7cd9fe_story.html\">s worked through that weekend </a>trying to pinpoint a problem on its side, and when it couldn\u2019t find any arranged for a Jan. 14 meeting with the District for additional checks, two days after the L\u2019Enfant Plaza incident occurred.

This Thursday, it motored toward the Vietnamese coast under protection of a naval vessel. Pirates of unknown nationality had seized the ship Oct. 2 and kept its crew hostage while they siphoned a third of its cargo: some 2,000 metric tons of oil. \"They put knives on our throats and threatened to kill us if we resist,\" the ship's deputy captain <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/vietnam-tanker-missing-hijacked-pirates-26035071\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the Associated Press by cellphone.

The lands flanking these waters have been contested by local kingdoms and sultanates, Arabs, Chinese, and the forces of European colonial powers. Singapore, one of the world's most important ports, emerged in the 19th century as a pivotal entrepot straddling this passage. It was also, in its early days, a <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1893032,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">haven for pirates</a>.

In <a href=\"http://www.aei-ideas.org/2011/03/dealing-with-somali-pirates-lessons-from-the-strait-of-malacca/\" target=\"_blank\">a 2011 report</a>, the American Enterprise Institute, a D.C-based conservative think tank, hailed the success of the \"Malaccan formula\": An international task force began patrolling the waters off Somalia's lengthy coastline along a similar model, forcing Somali pirate \"motherships\" further afield from their bases on shore. The number of pirate attacks dried up, with piracy off West Africa's coast now becoming <a href=\"http://www.joc.com/maritime-news/maritime-piracy/rise-west-african-piracy-requires-new-approach-shipping-industry-report-says_20141005.html\" target=\"_blank\">a greater security concern</a>. Piracy monitors caution that the recent spike in attacks near the Malacca Strait <a href=\"http://www.icc-ccs.org/news/947-imb-reports-worrying-trend-of-small-tanker-hijacks-in-southeast-asian-waters\" target=\"_blank\">involves</a> many \"low-level thefts,\" including raids and burglaries conducted at night when ships are at anchor in port. The growing trend does not necessarily mean there's a greater deterioration and pirate threat in the region. This year alone, the U.S. navy held <a href=\"http://www.stripes.com/news/navy-wraps-up-carat-exercise-in-singapore-1.298162\" target=\"_blank\">military exercises with Singapore</a> that focused in part on anti-piracy maneuvers.

{"docId": "0e85b0c0-f7ef-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81", "title": "Meet the Mirai: Why Toyota wants to make your next car run on hydrogen", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "The Toyota sedan cruising last week down a leafy suburban parkway was like any family car on the road, save for one key detail: Its power was coming not from gasoline but hydrogen, stored in tanks beneath the seats. The first mass-market car to run off hydrogen, the $57,500 Mirai, has quickly become a powerful force in the battle for tomorrow\u2019s roads. The four-seater can drive farther and refuel faster than any electric car a driver can buy. But the world\u2019s biggest car company, even before the Mirai\u2019s first California sale in October, is placing a massively risky bet on hydrogen, now sold at only a dozen American fueling stations. For many, it still evokesthe Hindenburg and the hydrogen bomb. The type of hydrogen fuel cells that run the Mirai have been repeatedly tried and abandoned by rival automakers, and electric-car pioneers have panned the technology as unrealistic and doomed to fail. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pick an energy source mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,\u201d Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, Toyota\u2019s chief rival in the electric-car market, said in January. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, and that will become apparent in the next few years.\u201d Think of the Mirai as a small power plant on wheels. Instead of drawing energy from a battery, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt, the all-electric Mirai makes its own, by gulping in air and mixing it with hydrogen in a stack of fuel cells. The reaction cleanly powers the motor and belches out no exhaust, save for a thin trickle of water. Boosters of zero-emission vehicles have praised the Mirai \u2014 whose name in Japanese means \u201cfuture\u201d \u2014 as a solution to some of electric cars\u2019 thorniest problems. The sedan can drive 300 miles on a full tank and be refueled in about five minutes \u2014 instead of needing to be plugged in overnight \u2014 making it an easier fit for the typical commute. Toyota has a track record for this sort of disruption, having built the first mass-produced hybrid, the Prius, from an experimental laughingstock into a clean and unexciting mainstream sedan. While still a niche \u2014 hybrids make up only 3 percent of American car sales \u2014 the Prius became emblematic of a way normal drivers could help save the world without trying too hard. \u201cToyota is so big that it can still be a science experiment for them,\u201d said David Whiston, an equity strategist with investment researcher Morningstar. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, they can go back to selling Priuses and all the other gas guzzlers no one ever talks about.\u201d Yet these are very different roads than the ones the Prius first rolled onto 18 years ago. When drivers first bought the hybrid, they already had ways to fuel it \u2014 and no easier alternative if they wanted a greener drive. Today, the Mirai faces competition not just from electric vehicles but from traditional gas guzzlers, which because of tougher federal emissions standards drive more efficiently than ever. Traditional vehicles are also far cheaper: Though Toyota is pledging three years of free hydrogen and more than $5,000 in federal and state incentives could bring down the cost, the Mirai is about twice as pricey as the average mid-size sedan. Musk, whose company makes the electric flagship Model S, has become one of fuel cells\u2019 most vocal critics, calling them \u201cextremely silly\u201d \u201cfool cells\u201d that siphon money and attention from the efficient battery systems that run most electric cars, including his. Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has slammed the idea that a country as vast as the United States could efficiently build a network of hydrogen stations nearly from scratch. For Toyota, it could become a globe-spanning chicken-or-egg problem: That there are few hydrogen stations could lead to fewer drivers \u2014 and fewer of the customers those stations need to survive. Toyota, the $236 billion Japanese juggernaut, is starting small, with plans to make available only 3,000 Mirais in the United States by 2017, a sum close to the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold in a day. Most of those cars will cruise solely in California, home to 10 of the country\u2019s 12 hydrogen refueling stations. Though other hydrogen fueling centers operate in Connecticut and South Carolina and more are in development, building or outfitting a station to supply the universe\u2019s lightest element can cost $1 million or more. That slow start and scant infrastructure could limit how much hydrogen power can accomplish. In a report last year to investors, Citi Research analysts said they expect fuel-cell cars such as the Mirai to \u201chave little impact on the auto market\u201d until at least 2020. Environmental advocates have also questioned just how eco-friendly the Mirai can be. Hydrogen today is mostly produced from natural gas, a fossil fuel, and must be trucked to stations via tankers, unaided by the kind of nationwide grid that fuels battery-powered cars. Energy experts say hydrogen, over time, will increasingly come from clean renewable sources such as wind and solar. The Mirai, Toyota executives argue, is only the first step of a energy evolution that one said was the carmaker\u2019s vision for \u201cthe next 100 years.\u201d But the company is already pushing back on early skepticism, launching a \u201cFueled by Bulls--t\u201d ad campaign named for one of Musk\u2019s critiques to explain how hydrogen can be sourced from cow manure. The carmaker has also attempted to swat back safety concerns. Hydrogen is odorless and flammable but no more dangerous than gasoline and disperses quickly in case of leaks, company officials say. (To guard against those, engineers have gone so far as to fire high-caliber rounds to test the Mirai\u2019s bulletproof hydrogen tanks.) The automaker has also taken to touting the Mirai\u2019s versatility beyond the road. A plug in the trunk can turn the car into a mobile generator, the company says, delivering enough juice to power the average American home\u2019s essentials for a week. Even in the small-batch world of environmentally friendly automaking, the Mirai\u2019s production is an oddity, pieced together without use of a robot or conveyor belt in Toyota\u2019s sprawling Motomachi plant in Japan. A dozen specialized workers in blue hard hats assemble the car by hand, turning out about three a day. Though no other automaker has pushed to mass-produce hydrogen cars, the Mirai is far from the first car to embark on the path to alternative power. Hydrogen-powered cars, such as the Hyundai Tucson, have gained loyal if microscopic followings in California. Honda, which recently retired its small line of FCX Clarity fuel-cell cars, said it plans to sell a space-age upgrade of the car, the FCV, sometime next spring. Toyota\u2019s hydrogen crusade has gained a spirited boost in its home country of Japan, which plans to install fuel-cell stacks in more than 5 million homes over the next 15 years. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the first to own a Mirai, in December, and he recently celebrated the opening of Tokyo\u2019s first hydrogen station as \u201cthe dawn of a true hydrogen society.\u201d But this new age will require heavy government investment at levels American policymakers and taxpayers might be less excited about. Japan is now offering subsidies of 3 million yen, or about $25,000, to buyers of fuel-cell vehicles in Tokyo, which has pledged $375 million worth of hydrogen-related development before the city\u2019s 2020 Olympics. Like the Prius, the Mirai could be what industry insiders call a \u201chalo car,\u201d a flagship meant to boost Toyota\u2019s eco-friendly image rather than drive sales. That, skeptics say, would make Toyota\u2019s boasting of a \u201chydrogen era\u201d and the evolution of the Mirai more a marketing tactic than revolutionary act. But in the end, the trickiest obstacle for advanced fuel-cell cars might prove to be a simple one: price. At its cheapest, the Mirai can be leased for $499 a month, three times the cost of a new Corolla set to sip historically cheap gas. To succeed, Toyota will need to get \u201csome people on board and willing to spend $50,000 on a compact car,\u201d said Whiston, the Morningstar equity strategist. \u201cMuch like with Tesla, [buyers] will have to pay up for the privilege of saving the world.\u201d<br /> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 37510.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 37520.0, "text": "Nissan", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Nissan ", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 37530.0, "text": "Morningstar", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Morningstar, Inc.", "entityid": 1373542}, {"id": 37540.0, "text": "Tesla", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Tesla, Inc.", "entityid": 5533631}, {"id": 37550.0, "text": "Carlos Ghosn", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Carlos Ghosn", "entityid": 1340627}, {"id": 37560.0, "text": "Japan", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Japan", "entityid": 15554}, {"id": 37570.0, "text": "Ford", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Ford Motor Company ", "entityid": 15554}, {"id": 37580.0, "text": "Connecticut", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Connecticut", "entityid": 6466}, {"id": 37590.0, "text": "Chevrolet", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Chevrolet", "entityid": 39848}, {"id": 37510.0, "text": "Honda", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Honda", "entityid": 13729}, {"id": 37511.0, "text": "Hindenburg", "wiki_title": "enwiki:LZ 129 Hindenburg", "entityid": 55106}, {"id": 37512.0, "text": "Shinzo Abe", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Shinz%C5%8D Abe", "entityid": 55106}, {"id": 37513.0, "text": "Toyota", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Toyota", "entityid": 30984}, {"id": 37514.0, "text": "Citi", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Citigroup", "entityid": 207299}, {"id": 37515.0, "text": "Motomachi", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Toyota, Aichi", "entityid": 329044}, {"id": 37516.0, "text": "South Carolina", "wiki_title": "enwiki:South Carolina", "entityid": 27956}, {"id": 37517.0, "text": "Hyundai", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Hyundai ", "entityid": 27956}, {"id": 37518.0, "text": "California", "wiki_title": "enwiki:California", "entityid": 5407}, {"id": 37519.0, "text": "Musk", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Elon Musk", "entityid": 909036}]}

But to many in the embattled Mediterranean nation, it sounded more like a threat. The hard line on Greece adopted by Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse has, if anything, strengthened in the days since Greek voters <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/greeks-cast-ballot-on-nations-future-in-europe/2015/07/05/cbb0a734-20d7-11e5-a135-935065bc30d0_story.html\">resoundingly rejected</a> tougher cuts, sending shock waves through the continent. Now Germany is refusing to budge on cutting Greece\u2019s mountain of debt, even as the leftist leadership here \u2014 and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 insist that no deal is viable without such a reduction. This tough stance comes from a rules-oriented nation where even the language is conspiring against Greece\u2019s struggles: Germans use the same word for \u201cdebt\u201d and for \u201cguilt.\u201d \u201cOf course we do not want to abandon the Greeks, but they do not have to be a member of the euro zone in order to receive help,\u201d said Christian von Stetten, a lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, summarizing an increasingly prevalent view in the German capital. \u201cIf, from the very beginning, there had been sanctions for not sticking to the rules, we would not have this problem,\u201d von Stetten said. He noted that Greece was not the only member of the 19-nation euro zone to run afoul of the thicket of regulations that govern borrowing and spending in the monetary union. The mounting German anger after the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/on-eve-of-vote-greek-finance-minister-accuses-europe-of-terrorism/2015/07/04/412da8fa-5078-4b60-abe6-4bf842f35d60_story.html\">Greek referendum on Sunday</a> is a major challenge for Merkel, who, as the euro zone\u2019s most powerful leader, needs to hold together its fractious members while preserving her domestic standing. She does not want to be blamed for a sudden Greek exit from the euro zone, but giving away too much would cost her at home. France and others are starting to break away, calling for a softened deal in the aftermath of the referendum. Merkel\u2019s electorate, however, has had no such turnabout. Nor have her political allies. \u201cToday we need the Iron Chancellor: No new billions for Greece!\u201d read the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelbirnbaum/status/618336623223263232\">front-page headline</a> in Tuesday\u2019s Bild tabloid, the top-circulating newspaper in Germany. It was accompanied by a doctored image of Merkel sporting a spiked helmet of the kind worn by Otto von Bismarck, the 19th-century leader who conquered Europe to build the German empire. \u201cA lot of people in the government have moved toward the position where they say, \u2018Let\u2019s get rid of them no matter what,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. Many Germans say that without steely regulations to govern the conduct of European nations, the 63-year-old project to integrate the continent would swiftly fall apart. Giving in to populists in Greece would embolden others like them in places such as Spain and Italy, they say, and soon there would be a wave of political and economic upheaval across Europe. Merkel has repeatedly shot down Greek bailout proposals that insist on debt relief. As the clock ticked Tuesday on the collapse of the Greek banking sector, she again said ahead of a meeting of euro-zone leaders that she did not see any basis for negotiations. The tough approach aligns well with Germany\u2019s broader attitudes toward rules and predictability. Germany is a nation where jaywalking is rare, even when streets are clear of cars, and where most subway stations use the honor system, operating without turnstiles. The adherence to rules is such a key tenet of life there that many Germans say they would rather send humanitarian aid if Greece goes bankrupt than forgive its debts and risk breaking the covenant that when money is borrowed, it must be repaid. Until the introduction of the euro, bankrupt individuals in Germany could wipe out their debts only after 30 years. Credit card usage in the country is among the lowest in Europe, and even many big-box stores there take only cash. That maximalist approach toward Greece, however, could prove costlier for German taxpayers, because the struggling nation would be unable to repay Germany\u2019s $88 billion share of European rescue loans if it went bankrupt. A debt reduction would slice only a share off Greece\u2019s towering obligations. But many German leaders are dead set against compromise. \u201cGreece\u2019s entry into the euro zone was very naive from today\u2019s perspective,\u201d German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told the newsmagazine Stern on Tuesday. Gabriel is also the leader of the center-left Social Democrats. \u201cNothing is gained if we just cut debt without fundamental changes in Greece,\u201d Gabriel said. On Monday, he said E.U. countries needed to start readying humanitarian aid for Greece. He spoke from his party\u2019s headquarters in Berlin, where red flags still fly and Karl Marx\u2019s images adorn office walls. Similar parties in other countries have long favored stimulus spending and fought austerity, so his position is emblematic of the stark differences in German discourse. If Greece exits the euro zone, the aid may well be necessary. Greece imports much of its food and almost all of its medicine. Without a working banking system, or with a sharply devalued new currency, Greeks would struggle to pay for the basics while the cost of imports would rise sharply. After just over a week of capital controls that prevent Greeks from sending payments outside the country, shortages of staples are starting to appear. Some critics say that Germany\u2019s aversion to softening Greece\u2019s debt obligations ignores its own history. In a recent interview with Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper, economist Thomas Piketty pointed to Germany\u2019s post-World War II debt restructuring. That deal, done under different circumstances, wiped away about half of what Germany owed other nations, including Greece. As basics dwindle on the shelves of Greek supermarkets, Merkel is playing a tricky balancing act, with much to lose if she takes a strong stand on either side of whether Greece should remain in the euro zone. Her legacy would suffer if she were seen as kicking the Greeks off the common currency. But if she advocates debt relief, voters may punish her at home. Already, her even tougher finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has started to surpass her in popularity polls. Merkel \u201cwants to avoid it being her to decide over this,\u201d said Stefan Kornelius, author of a biography of the chancellor. He also wrote a column published Tuesday saying it was time for Greece to leave the euro zone. \u201cShe wants the Greek government to decide. She set the rules, and she wants Greece either to commit to it or leave it,\u201d Kornelius added.

Facing a Thursday deadline to submit a full plan and a Sunday end-date to strike a final deal or risk the collapse of its financial system, Greece on Wednesday officially asked its European partners for a new three-year rescue. In a <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/greece-releases-an-official-request-for-a-new-3-year-bailout-program/1637/\">one-page letter</a>, \u00adobtained by The Washington Post, Greece promised to take fresh steps on contentious issues such as taxes and pension payouts as early as next week. It also pledged to take unspecified \u201cadditional actions\u201d to \u201cstrengthen and modernize\u201d its nearly bankrupt economy. Greece, though, said it would not provide full details until Thursday, leaving European leaders guessing whether Athens was truly prepared to make tough sacrifices to win a new deal less than a week after Greek voters resoundingly rejected a previous cash-for-cuts offer by its euro-zone partners. For their part, officials said that although they wanted to keep Greece in the euro zone, they were also prepared to let it go. Athens also did not specify the size of its bailout request. But the International Monetary Fund has said it needs at least $66 billion through 2018 along with far more generous payment terms. Yet the Tuesday decision by European leaders to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/with-greeces-fate-on-the-line-european-leaders-to-gather-for-critical-summit/2015/07/07/ca99ab8a-242d-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html\">impose hard deadlines </a>on Greece \u2014 which it must meet or risk a possible end to aid for its banks from the European Central Bank and ejection from the euro currency union \u2014 raised the prospect of a potentially ugly endgame to a 5\u00bd-year debt crisis. In Washington, alarm was mounting that the crisis was entering a dangerous stage of brinkmanship, with new and uncertain risks for Europe and global markets. \u201cThe risk of an accident goes up dramatically when you create more of these kind of life-and-death deadlines,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in comments at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Wednesday. In Athens, concern was also clearly growing. The ECB declined on Wednesday to increase its lending to embattled Greek financial institutions, leaving banks to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/greek-banks-likely-to-reduce-atm-withdrawal-limits-without-more-funding/2015/07/08/cac1989d-dbdd-4685-80c1-0c85acdca746_story.html\">extend closures </a>that began June 29 through at least Friday. ATM limits of 60 euros per day per customer were extended through Sunday, even as some pharmacies began complaining of shortages of medicine. At one pharmacy off the city\u2019s main Syntagma Square, druggist Ion Oikonomakis had to turn away two customers seeking asthma and pain medicine on Wednesday. The 52-year-old said he was unable to import the drugs because of the new limits on the flow of cash. Oikonomakis said he was convinced the country would soon be forced to return to its former currency, the drachma. He blamed Greece\u2019s overly generous pension benefits for the country\u2019s economic struggles. Retirees are a key voting bloc, and politicians are only too ready to pander to them, he said. \u201cNobody can pay for all these people,\u201d he said. In Washington, Lew also appeared to support a controversial assessment from the IMF that Greece\u2019s 320 billion euro ($355 billion) debt load was so unsustainably large that some form for debt forgiveness by its creditor nations was now inevitable. That position is considered highly controversial in some countries in Europe, chiefly Germany, whose hardworking taxpayers may need to bid auf Wiedersehen to billions of euros under such a deal. Nevertheless, some key European decision makers \u2014 most important, France \u2014 sounded new notes of optimism that a deal could be reached. And Greek officials, who have demanded debt relief in exchange for any fresh cuts, also signaled they may be willing to accept a pledge for debt forgiveness later this year rather than an immediate concession to secure a quick deal. But serious doubts remained whether the Greek proposal would go far enough to assuage concerns in Germany, Greece\u2019s largest creditor nation, whose chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be the chief decider on any deal. \u201cThe chancellor has always maintained that the fundamental principle must be aid against reforms, and I do not think that she is ready to give up this position,\u201d said Nicolai von Ondarza, a policy analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Even if Merkel did, he cautioned, German lawmakers \u2014 who must give their approval to any deal \u2014 are unlikely to be as forgiving. Last week, Merkel had largely succeeded in securing widespread backing in Europe for Berlin\u2019s hard-line position that a no vote in Greece against austerity in last Sunday\u2019s referendum would effectively be a choice to leave the euro. But since the vote, France and other nations appear to have been deeply struck by fears that a Grexit \u2014 or Greece exit from the euro zone \u2014 is no longer a theoretical possibility. Such an event, they fear, could affect the future of European economic and political unity and create a failed state on Europe\u2019s southeastern flank. So deep is French concern that it has offered technical assistance to the Greeks as they seek to put a new proposal forward. \u201cKeeping Greece in the euro and, therefore, in the heart of Europe, and the E.U. is something of the utmost geostrategic and geopolitical importance,\u201d French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told lawmakers in Paris on Wednesday. \u201cAllowing Greece to exit the euro zone would be an admission of impotence \u2014 France refuses that.\u201d With the Greek economy on the verge of free fall, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras issued an impassioned plea for a new deal to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, provoking both \u00adapplause and boos, and touching off a fiery day of debate over his tactics. \u201cWe will continue with our reforms undertaken, but let us not forget that the Greek people have made a tremendous effort for adjustment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has exhausted the resilience and patience of the Greek people.\u201d But even as Tsipras spoke in Strasbourg, his allies back home recognized that Greece\u2019s bargaining position was poor, despite Sunday\u2019s landslide rejection of austerity. Several of Tsipras\u2019s closest allies said their strongest argument to Europe was that if Greece were kicked off the euro, further economic turmoil would befall the remaining euro zone nations. \u201cWe know that we are the weak player in the game,\u201d said Greek Labor Minister Panos Skourletis. \u201cIf we have an agreement, we will have austerity measures.\u201d He said that Tsipras was willing to concede on austerity if he won some reprieve for Greece\u2019s towering pile of debt. Above all, Greece needs a deal, he said, because within weeks it may not even have the cash to pay pensions. \u201cI believe we have enough until the end of July,\u201d he said.

Since Greek banks were shuttered June 29, the second-generation egg farmer has seen business drop by 30 percent. He\u2019s still selling out of his own hens\u2019 daily production of 5,000 eggs but has cut back on reselling from wholesalers, some of whom are racing to find buyers before stocks go bad. Cash- and credit-starved supermarkets, he said, are reducing their inventories. \u201cIf they run out of eggs, they run out of eggs.\u201d For some troubled bakeries, it\u2019s now either eggs or flour. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to go with flour,\u201d he said. Just as problematic is a crisis in payments. With tight controls on financial transactions, Kalyvas has to cover his daily costs in hard-to-find cash, leading him to demand payments in cash, too. It\u2019s money that many of his clients simply don\u2019t have. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a deal with Europe <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> Greece is doomed,\u201d Kalyvas said. \u201cBut even if we do, things are not going to get better fast.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/greek-leader-calls-for-a-new-deal-with-europe-for-beleaguered-greeks/2015/07/08/7f3eabe4-24e2-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html\">Greece</a> and its European creditors <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/high-stakes-talks-continue-over-greeces-future/2015/07/11/879019d6-2645-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html?hpid=z1\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">failed </a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/high-stakes-talks-continue-over-greeces-future/2015/07/11/879019d6-2645-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html?hpid=z1\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">to agree </a>Saturday <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/high-stakes-talks-continue-over-greeces-future/2015/07/11/879019d6-2645-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html?hpid=z1\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/high-stakes-talks-continue-over-greeces-future/2015/07/11/879019d6-2645-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html?hpid=z1\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\"></a>on a plan aimed at winning this nation its third bailout package since 2010, with the region deeply divided over a rescue and several nations calling for more efforts by Athens before final negotiations can begin. Any agreement will mean years more of painful austerity, but failure to reach one soon could be worse \u2014 triggering a quick collapse of the Greek financial system and its likely exit from the 19-member euro currency union. Yet even if a deal is struck, Greece could, for a period, remain something akin to a financial zombie state. Already, Greeks cannot download certain cellphone apps or buy songs on Apple\u2019s iTunes, because the capital controls imposed two weeks ago bar international transactions via Greek banks. As of last week, 29 international airlines stopped accepting reservations from Greek travel agencies because of doubts they could cover the costs of booked tickets. Pantelis Avramidis, chief executive of premier beer maker Elixis, said he is stuck with 1,381 gallons of beer in vats on his factory floor because he cannot transfer money to his Italian bottle supplier. In two weeks the batch will spoil. \u201cI\u2019m 50. I\u2019ve worked all my life. I\u2019m a self-made entrepreneur,\u201d Avramidis said. \u201cI\u2019m running out of time to start over, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m running out of cash as well.\u201d If Greece\u2019s creditors do not open the door to a new bailout this weekend, the big question remains whether the European Central Bank will agree to increase liquidity for Greek banks Monday. If it does, banks here could reopen as soon as Tuesday, potentially allowing limited financial transactions to restart. If it doesn\u2019t, capital controls could be tightened rather than loosened in a bid to prevent Greek banks from collapsing. Yet even if a bailout deal comes together and the ECB jumps in to aid Greece, some limits on bank withdrawals and transfers are likely to remain in place for at least two months, Greece\u2019s economy minister, George Stathakis, told local television on Saturday. Some analysts predict such controls could linger even longer, citing the recent banking crisis in nearby Cyprus that saw such measures extended for two years. \u201cThe question is how long it takes to restore confidence in the banking system,\u201d said a senior Greek banking official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the issue. Faced with extreme uncertainty, the economy here has gone topsy-turvy. Greeks are limited to ATM withdrawals of 60 euros \u2014 about $66 \u2014 a day. But they can use their bank debit cards to spend more, up to their daily limit, at stores that accept them. Some Greeks fear that the money in their accounts could be seized and devalued into a new currency if no deal is reached with Europe, so they are rushing to spend what\u2019s there. That means a buying spree of big-ticket, imported items such as washing machines, computers, even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/chanel-trumps-cash-in-greeces-crisis-economy/2015/07/07/9072e416-24ab-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html\">Chanel bags</a>. But Greeks are largely forgoing more run-of-the-mill purchases \u2014 leaving stores such as Paul \u00adPapanikolaou\u2019s bedding shop in central Athens battling sales drops of 90 percent since the capital controls hit. Just as well, because without the ability to make international bank transfers, he said, he is unable to bring in fresh stocks of sheets and towels from his suppliers in China and Pakistan. \u201cEveryone is trying to figure out how long they can last under these conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on when banks really open fully again. A week? Two weeks? Without some kind of normal system, some businesses won\u2019t last a month.\u201d Most painful for businesses such as Kalyvas Estate is that after years of setbacks, things had finally begun looking up before this latest crisis. Founded by his father, the company went from tiny pens of hand-fed chickens in the 1950s to a mechanized egg farm in the 1980s. After Greece adopted the euro in 1999 and credit became more accessible, Kalyvas made further investments, installing a refrigerated room by his ivy-covered henhouse to keep eggs fresh longer. After Greece slipped into its debt crisis in 2010, business fell 50 percent, he said, as supermarkets consolidated and other clients turned to far cheaper eggs from neighboring Bulgaria. But last year, as Greece\u2019s economy found a pulse, so did his business. He felt confident enough to invest in a $350,000 expansion that would have boosted his production by a third. \u201cThings were getting better,\u201d he said, looking at the empty row of henhouses he had installed two weeks before the bank closures. He canceled his order for the chickens to fill them after capital controls went into effect. \u201cThese kindergartners running the country really messed things up,\u201d he said. The challenge now is how to carry on with normal business in a non\u00adfunctioning financial system. On Friday, Kalyvas chain-smoked and nursed a Coke as his sales assistant worked the phones. \u201cI\u2019m calling this client, because I know he pays in cash,\u201d said the assistant, Anastasia Berdoli, 46. But after a brief exchange, it\u2019s no sale. The client hadn\u2019t sold all the eggs he ordered earlier in the week. Greeks are allowed to make domestic online bank transfers. But many businesses here never set up Internet banking accounts, and others don\u2019t trust them, seeing the money locked up in their accounts now as being of dubious worth. So while cash is at a premium in Greece, it is also king. Doesn\u2019t Kalyvas know it. For months, he and his 46-year-old wife had been paying a doctor for fertility treatments as they tried to have a baby. But the doctor is demanding cash, so they have, for now, suspended the sessions. Kalyvas has enough feed \u2014 largely soy and corn imported from the United States \u2014 to feed the chickens through the end of the month. But his supplier is demanding cash for next month\u2019s supply. If they can\u2019t reach \u201can arrangement,\u201d Kalyvas said, he may be forced to slaughter some of the chickens to sell as meat. Yet amid the crazy insecurity of Greece right now, he said, he could understand the desire to be paid in something you can hold in your hand. He\u2019s selling to some old clients on account, hoping they can pay him when the banks reopen. But he has cut off some clients who can\u2019t pay in cash. \u201cThere is only so much risk you can take,\u201d he said. An hour after his assistant finished her sales calls, she came to Kalyvas with good news: a Monday order for 3,000 eggs on the Greek island of Crete. It was more eggs than he had on hand, so Kalyvas rang up a supplier in Athens, an hour\u2019s drive south. \u201cI need eggs,\u201d he told the wholesaler. \u201cCan I transfer the money into your account? Any bank you wish.\u201d No, he is told. Cash only. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Kalyvas said reluctantly. \u201cCash.\u201d <b>Read more:</b> <b></b> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/greek-leader-calls-for-a-new-deal-with-europe-for-beleaguered-greeks/2015/07/08/7f3eabe4-24e2-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Greece asks European partners for new three-year bailout</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/03/18-key-facts-about-greece-that-will-leave-you-totally-up-to-date-about-a-huge-crisis/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">18 key facts about Greece that will leave you totally up to date about a huge crisis</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/to-greeks-german-offers-of-help-sound-more-like-a-threat/2015/07/07/3c5be31e-24ab-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Germans would rather send humanitarian aid than forgive Greece\u2019s debts</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world\">Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world</a> "}], "saliency": []}

Modern Germany quickly molded itself into the standard-bearer of global pacifism, a hotbed of youth culture and the tree-hugging Lorax of nations in the fight against climate change. But, just like that, the image of the \u201ccruel German\u201d is back. Germany \u2014 more specifically, its chancellor, Angela Merkel \u2014 has faced years of derision for driving a hard bargain with financially broken Greece, which has received billions in bailouts since 2010. But for both Germany and Merkel, the concessions extracted this week from Athens appear to have struck a global nerve. By insisting on years more of tough cuts and making other demands that critics have billed as humiliating, Berlin is wiping out decades of hard-won goodwill. In the aftermath of the deal with Greece, the hashtag #Boycottgermany \u2014 calling on users not to buy German products \u2014 has started trending on Twitter. Evoking Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal from \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d some are sharing caricatures depicting Merkel as an E.U.-eating <a href=\"http://cuestionhumana.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Angela-Lecter.jpg\">\u201cAngela Lecter.\u201d</a> A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carclosa/status/620892568163876864\">cartoon</a> portraying Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble \u2014 Merkel\u2019s even-harder-line finance minister \u2014 as a knife-wielding killer from the Islamic State militant group has gone viral. Germany was one of more than a dozen nations that insisted on a tough deal with Greece. But Britain\u2019s Daily Mail singled out Germany, saying Greece had surrendered to austerity \u201cwith a German gun at his head.\u201d In the United States, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/angry-germans/\">this week noted</a> the hate mail he had received from Germany for repeatedly criticizing its tough line on fiscal reforms. The Germans, he wrote, had suggested that as a Jew, he should know \u201cthe dangers of demonizing a people.\u201d To that, Krugman responded with sarcasm: \u201cBecause criticizing a nation\u2019s economic ideology is <i>just like</i> declaring its people subhuman.\u201d In Greece, those actively supporting the austerity deal are being heckled by their countrymen as \u201cNazi collaborators.\u201d Another image making the rounds on social media shows a doctored version of the European Union flag, its circle of gold stars against a blue background reshaped into a swastika. French daily Le Figaro declared that \u201cconditions were imposed on a small member state that would have previously required arms.\u201d In a commentary that sneered at Merkel\u2019s \u201chalf smile\u201d after the deal was reached, Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper argued that rather than being cruel to be kind, the terms of the bailout were simply \u201ccruel to be cruel.\u201d In its online edition, even Germany\u2019s own Der Spiegel magazine decried the Berlin-led demands as \u201cthe catalogue of cruelties.\u201d In a country that can be highly sensitive about its brutal past, some Germans are beside themselves. On Friday, the German parliament is set to vote on whether to green-light rescue talks under the onerous new terms. It is expected to vote yes. In any case, some argue, the damage to Germany\u2019s image has been done. \u201cMerkel, Sch\u00e4uble and [Vice Chancellor Sigmar] Gabriel in two and a half days burned the trust that had been built over 25 years,\u201d Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, a German politician from the progressive Green Party, declared during an emotional outburst on local television. \u201cThe heartless, dictatorial and ugly Germany again has a face, and that is Sch\u00e4uble.\u201d He finished by saying, \u201cI am upset, as you can see, very upset.\u201d But much of the nation seems to be taking the latest round of German-bashing in stride.

And that is the way the Germans like it. That mind-set, many here insist, has helped Germany rebuild into an efficient, competitive and modern economy that is the envy of Europe. As the largest economy and de facto leader of the 19-member euro zone, Germany has rules that many here believe must be respected. They find it disturbing, even insulting, that some would equate German calls for fiscal restraint with the inhumanity of the Nazis. If some Germans have chided Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble, even more have expressed support. \u201cNow we are saying no,\u201d declared the conservative German tabloid Bild, referring to the recent Greek referendum on austerity measures. One German user on Twitter dared the rest of the world to boycott German products: \u201cGo ahead. Boycott all german goods. cars, aspirin, beer, chip cards, printed media and antibiotics. Have fun.\u201d Some here assert that Germany\u2019s firm stance on Greek debt may instead work in its favor. Christian Rieck, a professor of economic theory at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, said the tough posture will help because it shows Germany\u2019s \u201cability to follow through.\u201d And, perhaps most important for the chancellor, Merkel is getting pats on the back from German voters. Walter Dombrovski, a 51-year old graphic designer in Berlin, said, \u201cWe have to stay tough.\u201d \u201cThere are rules,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody pays any taxes in Greece. Not just the rich, also the little people don\u2019t pay taxes. And they carry a bundle of cash in their pocket at all times. Corruption is a part of everyday life there.\u201d But others here believe Germany is being shortsighted and heading down a dangerous path of disunity with the rest of the continent. Martin Glaser, a 51-year old Berliner who works in public relations, said: \u201cI think it is a scandal. To humiliate a country in this way is not acceptable.\u201d \u201cEven though the polls show that there is widespread support for Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble, I think that many Germans would say that they don\u2019t want this kind of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cA Europe which is ruled by Germany in this way is not the democratic Europe that I would like to have.\u201d <b>Read more:</b> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/greek-leader-calls-for-a-new-deal-with-europe-for-beleaguered-greeks/2015/07/08/7f3eabe4-24e2-11e5-b621-b55e495e9b78_story.html?hpid=z1\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Greek leader calls for a new deal with Europe for beleaguered Greeks</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/01/the-forgotten-origins-of-greeces-terrible-crisis-will-make-you-think-twice-about-whos-to-blame/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">The forgotten origins of Greece\u2019s crisis will make you think twice about who\u2019s to blame</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/15/europes-dirty-little-secret-is-greece-will-never-pay-back-its-debt/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Europe\u2019s dirty little secret is Greece will never pay back its debt</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/greece-approves-divisive-austerity-for-bailout-but-political-shakeup-awaits/2015/07/16/0e4f7de2-2b21-11e5-960f-22c4ba982ed4_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Greece braces for political shake-up after austerity vote</a> "}], "saliency": []}

Only six people younger than 34, like Maynard, have used it. \u201cNow we have a young woman getting people in her generation interested in the issue,\u201d Caplan wrote in article published on <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/833603\">Medscape</a>. \u201cCritics are worried about her partly because she\u2019s speaking to that new audience, and they know that the younger generation of America has shifted attitudes about gay marriage and the use of marijuana, and maybe they are going to have that same impact in pushing physician-assisted suicide forward. \u201cShe may change politics right here.\u201d Her story commanded national attention. Before she died, she launched <a href=\"http://www.thebrittanyfund.org/\">her own campaign</a> with Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group for the terminally ill. She drew support from lawmakers in Connecticut and New Jersey. \u201cI think [legislation] could get out of the Senate,\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester County) told the <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/health/20141030_Brittany_Maynard__death_with_dignity_or_exploitation_.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. Burzichelli, the bill\u2019s sponsor, thinks it will pass New Jersey\u2019s state legislature this year. Even the women on \u201cThe View\u201d debated her right to die. Big names like Rosie O\u2019Donnell said to have \u201ccontrol over your own death, when you\u2019ve had no control for so long over your illness, I think is the human thing to do.\u201d But \u201cassisted suicide\u201d summons up deep religious and ethical concerns among some critics, including many Catholics and those associated with the Right to Life movement. While organizations have avoided criticizing Maynard, many have come out against the media and advocacy groups for what they consider exploitation of her story to gain a political edge. National Right to Life called Compassion & Choices \u201cghoulish\u201d in its representation of Maynard\u2019s tragedy. \u201cWhile we would never criticize Maynard,\u201d National Right to Life said on it <a href=\"http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/2014/10/brittany-maynard-delays-decision-to-end-her-own-life-this-saturday/#.VFcpj_nF-So\">Web site</a>, \u201cwe are angry that Compassion & Choices would exploit her tragedy for its own malevolent purposes. Maynard\u2019s case is what groups like Compassion & Choices live for, a beautiful young woman about to be cut down in the prime of her life. It matters not that such cases \u2014 authentically terminal illnesses \u2014 are always the opening wedge after which, once the principal is established, the \u2018right\u2019 to be \u2018assisted\u2019 expands to a whole panoply of reasons none of which are about terminal illnesses. Compassion & Choice\u2019s agenda extends far beyond terminally ill 29-year-old women.\u201d And even though Maynard\u2019s story, which was documented in TV interviews and popular magazines, inspired a community of supporters, there were also social media efforts devoted to persuading her to choose a different course. Ira Byock, chief medical officer of the Institute for Human Caring of Providence Health and Services, spoke loudly against the practice. \u201cWhen doctor-induced death becomes an accepted response to the suffering of dying people, logical extensions grease the slippery slope,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/10/06/expanding-the-right-to-die/doctor-assisted-suicide-is-unethical-and-dangerous\">New York Times op-ed</a>. He cited statistics in Holland, where the practice is permitted, that claim more than 40 people sought and received doctor-assisted death for depression and other mental disorders. \u201cEven <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/03/the-dutch-debate-doctor-assisted-suicide-for-depression.html\">the psychiatrist who began this practice</a> in the 90\u2019s recently declared the situation had gone \u2018off the rails.'\u201d Byock added: \u201cMoral outrage is appropriate and needed to fix the sorry state of dying in America. Legalizing assisted suicide fixes nothing. The principle that doctors must not kill patients stands.\u201d In <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/physician-assisted-suicide-legal_n_3913400.html\">a poll</a> conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine last year, 67 percent of more than 1,700 medical experts surveyed in the United States were against the physician-assisted suicide. That same year, a Pew Research survey showed <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/11/21/chapter-1-opinion-about-laws-on-doctor-assisted-suicide/\">public opinion was split</a>, with 47 percent of U.S. adults supporting the practice and 49 percent opposing it. Then a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/162815/support-euthanasia-hinges-described.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> that year suggested results varied according to how the question was presented: Some 70 percent of Americans were in favor of allowing physicians to \u201cend the patient\u2019s life by some painless means,\u201d but only 51 percent were in support of allowing doctors to help a patient \u201ccommit suicide.\u201d Compassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee, who drafted Oregon\u2019s Death With Dignity Act, argued with Byock on public television. \u201cHospice and palliative care is the gold standard,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/health/20141030_Brittany_Maynard__death_with_dignity_or_exploitation_.html\">she told Byock last month</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. But it\u2019s not a miracle. And it cannot prevent the kind of relentless, dehumanizing, horrific decline that Brittany faces, where her disease will cause unending seizures and headaches and nausea and vomiting and pressure in her brain, and the loss of every bodily function, including thinking and moving.\u201d Coombs Lee added: \u201cNo palliative care, terminal sedation, or promise of effective palliative care can give Maynard the thing she treasures now \u2026 the hope of gaining control over her disease before it takes her life.\u201d Late last month, Maynard took to <a href=\"http://www.thebrittanyfund.org/notes.php\">her blog</a> to address critics. \u201cI made my decisions based on my wishes, clinical research, choices, discussions with physicians, and logic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am not depressed or suicidal or on a \u2018slippery slope.\u2019 I have been in charge of this choice, gaining control of a terrifying terminal disease through the application of my own humane logic.\u201d Throughout the past month, she said that was the reason for her campaign \u2014 to fight for other terminally-ill patients in states without protections. Oregon, Vermont and Washington are currently the only three states that have death-with-dignity laws. Two other states, Montana and New Mexico, have court rulings that protect physicians who help patients die. Bills have been introduced in <a href=\"http://www.deathwithdignity.org/advocates/national\">seven other states</a>. But Caplan believes this is just the beginning. \u201cBrittany Maynard may change this debate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy forecast is that we are going to see more push to put these laws in the front of state legislatures and to get them on state ballots.

The testimony of Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, came a day after the regulatory agency said an additional 85 million vehicles could face air-bag recalls unless the manufacturer can prove they are safe. Almost 29 million cars already have been recalled after inflater ruptures killed 10 people in the United States and maimed at least 100 more. Rosekind said Thursday that the inflaters being installed in recalled vehicles may themselves become defective but that the evidence suggests they will perform to design for several years. \u201cAt this point we\u2019re only seeing ruptures at 7\u200a \n<fraction> \n <sup>1</sup>/ \n <sub>2 </sub> \n</fraction>years,\u201d Rosekind said. \u201cA certain number that are being replaced have at least a 7\u200a \n<fraction> \n <sup>1</sup>/ \n <sub>2</sub> \n</fraction>-year time span available for that safety to protect people in the vehicle.\u201d The news that some recalled vehicles may need to have their air-bag inflaters replaced twice adds a fresh layer of complexity to the issue. The air bags were manufactured by the world\u2019s largest maker of air bags, a Japanese firm named Takata, and installed by a majority of automakers. Unlike most air-bag makers, Takata uses ammonium nitrate to trigger a small explosion that inflates the air bag when the vehicle strikes something. But in some vehicles \u2014 particularly those that were several years old and kept in regions with high humidity \u2014 the ammonium nitrate burns too fast, causing the chemical\u2019s container to explode and spray drivers and passengers with metal shrapnel. Many Takata replacement air bags still use the ammonium nitrate that is suspected to cause the explosive malfunctions, and Rosekind said Thursday that testing has proved that the chemical deteriorates over time. Many air-bag inflaters have been replaced since the recalls began in 2014, and dealers should have notified drivers about whether their new inflaters were triggered by ammonium nitrate and whether they should be replaced a second time when inflaters without the chemical become available, Rosekind said. \u201cIf the dealer tells you that it\u2019s an interim remedy, then you would know that you\u2019ll be recalled again for a second fix,\u201d Rosekind said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to get that first [replacement] and think they\u2019re done.\u201d With replacement air bags on back order, many dealers have been telling drivers who have received recall notices that it may take weeks or months before their inflaters can be replaced. Getting drivers to comply with recall notices is a challenge, said Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents 12 major foreign and domestic automakers. \u201cWe do mail and email until we\u2019re blue in the face,\u201d Bainwol told the House subcommittee. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. We need help.\u201d NHTSA is launching a pilot program in which automakers work with state motor-vehicle administrations to include recall information in renewal notices for licenses and auto registration. Six states will take part in the pilot program. \u201cAs much as is currently being done, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Rosekind said, enumerating 19 new strategies developed to draw the attention of drivers to recall notices. Huma Hanif, 17, died March 31 when an air bag malfunctioned after her car hit another vehicle at an intersection in suburban Houston. The auto dealer and Honda said they had sent six air-bag recall notices to Hanif\u2019s family, but family members said they had not received the notices. On Wednesday, NHTSA gave Takata until the end of 2019 to prove that their new process for ensuring the safety of inflaters triggered by ammonium nitrate is effective. The company is using a drying agent called desiccant to keep the chemical from deteriorating when exposed to heat and humidity. If Takata fails to provide that proof, it could lead to a recall of an additional 85 million cars. Rep. Janice Schakowsky (D-Ill.) asked Rosekind whether potentially defective air bags were being installed in newly manufactured cars. \u201cIt would be illegal to sell a known defect in a new car,\u201d Rosekind said. <i>An earlier version of this story stated that Takata has until the end of 2018 to prove that their new process for ensuring safety of inflaters is effective. The company has until the end of 2019.</i> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 39710.0, "text": "Congress", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States Congress", "entityid": 31756}, {"id": 39720.0, "text": "Mitch Bainwol", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mitch Bainwol", "entityid": 3647386}, {"id": 39730.0, "text": "House", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States House of Representatives", "entityid": 667130}, {"id": 39740.0, "text": "Rosekind", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mark Rosekind", "entityid": 46791234}, {"id": 39750.0, "text": "Ill", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Illinois", "entityid": 14849}, {"id": 39760.0, "text": "NHTSA", "wiki_title": "enwiki:National Highway Traffic Safety Administration", "entityid": 989530}, {"id": 39770.0, "text": "Japanese", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Japan", "entityid": 15554}, {"id": 39780.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 39790.0, "text": "Houston", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Houston", "entityid": 13774}, {"id": 39710.0, "text": "Takata", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Takata Corporation", "entityid": 26931149}, {"id": 39711.0, "text": "Janice Schakowsky", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Jan Schakowsky", "entityid": 412083}, {"id": 39712.0, "text": "Honda", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Honda", "entityid": 13729}, {"id": 39713.0, "text": "Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers", "entityid": 13304348}]}
{"docId": "72e72b41097d53b627fd375dd2d3309b", "title": "The solution to climate change that has nothing to do with cars or coal", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "AMAZONAS, Brazil \u2013 At the base of a towering, 150-foot-high angelim tree, the scattered sloth claws and clumps of fur are a dead giveaway. The tree contains the nest of a harpy eagle, a bird so powerful it kills monkeys and sloths by tearing them from the trees with its enormous claws. Its presence is a good sign to the scientists who are studying the surrounding forest. It means this section of trees and its vast network of life are still healthy enough to support such a high-order predator. And that, in turn, is at least a small bit of good news for the Earth\u2019s climate. Of all the components of the recent Paris accord on climate change, the one that probably got the least attention but could have the most immediate potential involves the world\u2019s forests. In a section some hailed as historic, the document endorsed a United Nations mechanism for wealthier nations to pay developing countries like Brazil for reducing deforestation. Trees are good at keeping carbon out of the air, and simply preserving the planet\u2019s vast forests is a straightforward way to get a huge head start on the business of slowing climate change. But that effort grows tougher every day. After years of progress, deforestation rates have increased recently in Brazil, and deforestation continues apace across much of the global tropics. The economic forces of agriculture and trade remain too strong to resist. Calls for saving rainforests have a long history, but including forests as a core part of the global climate solution is \u201cvery very recent,\u201d said Naoko Ishii, CEO of the Global Environment Facility, an international body that invests in restoring tropical forests. \u201cWithout taking care of the forests, it\u2019s going to be just impossible to achieve the Paris agreement.\u201d In fact, recent estimates suggest as much as a third of climate emissions could be offset by stopping deforestation and restoring forest land \u2014 and that this solution could be achieved much faster than cuts to fossil fuels. Forests are a crucial \u201ccarbon sink,\u201d living engines for absorbing and storing carbon. Tropical forests store the most carbon of all, and no tropical forest on Earth is bigger than the Amazon. It accounts for about half of all the carbon these forests store. But the Brazilian Amazon has lost nearly a fifth of its forest cover already \u2014 and the forest left behind also suffers because it is more fragmented and less continuous. Thomas Lovejoy, a George Mason University ecologist, has been studying this section of Amazon for decades. While he was encouraged to see the harpy eagle at its nest on a recent afternoon, he was conscious of the forest\u2019s overall fragility. The Amazon system as a whole, Lovejoy said, is at a \u201cprecarious point. And you know, the obvious thing is, you don\u2019t want to find out where the tipping point is by tipping it.\u201d <strong>Of trees and warming</strong><br /> The forest is protected in this roughly 4-square-mile federal research and conservation plot to the northeast of the city of Manaus, where the dark and acidic Rio Negro meets the more brownish Solim\u00f5es to form the lower Amazon river, the largest in the world. But not far from here, the smell of smoke still hangs over a recently deforested plot \u2013 trees slashed down and then burned. So it has gone throughout the Amazon, and far worse in more southern Brazilian states, such as Par\u00e1 and Mato Grosso. All of which makes the relentless focus on fossil fuels in the climate discussion \u2013 and the consigning of forests, at least until now, to a relative side role \u2013 somewhat puzzling. Forests, after all, are almost half carbon (if you leave out the water, that is). The billion year old process of photosynthesis stores carbon in the sugars that, in turn, fuel plant growth and metabolism. The storage of carbon is most intense in tropical forests, where a gigantic abundance of different types of trees, thick vines and epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants) are all fighting one another for a slice of direct tropical sunlight \u2013 only a sliver of which actually reaches the forest floor. Trees don\u2019t put down very deep roots here; they stretch them outward across the ground, over a layer of often sandy soil that isn\u2019t even very rich or fertile. If the land is cleared, not only is all the carbon lost to the atmosphere, but the result often isn\u2019t even very good farmland or pasture. Net greenhouse gas emissions due to tropical deforestation and forest degradation are about 8 to 15 percent of the global total, which doesn\u2019t sound like that much. But a recent study in Nature Climate Change found that stopping deforestation could nonetheless be a huge piece of the climate solution. That\u2019s because if tropical deforestation stopped, not only would those emissions go away, but on top of that, forests would start stowing away a significant part of the carbon from our fossil fuel emissions. \u201cOne could reduce total CO2 emissions by about 30 percent, just working in the land sector,\u201d said Phil Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a lot.\u201d Moreover, stopping deforestation could buy precious time to ratchet down fossil fuel emissions. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to suddenly convert everyone to electric cars, and power generation is gradually changing, but it\u2019s going to take decades,\u201d said Paul Salaman, CEO of the Rainforest Trust. \u201cBut tropical deforestation can literally be stopped point blank with commitment of countries.\u201d <strong>Why a fragmented forest stores less carbon</strong><br /> What science is revealing, meanwhile, is that it\u2019s not just deforestation itself that\u2019s the problem \u2013 it\u2019s also the damage to what\u2019s left behind. Camp 41, which is run collaboratively by Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Amazonian Research and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, is a scientific \u201ccontrol\u201d \u2013 an example of what happens when you just leave the rainforest alone and let it grow. By contrast, near here are several forest fragments, which Lovejoy helped preserve for research in the late 1970s after the surrounding land was set to be cleared for ranching. The study of these fragments, which has been ongoing since 1980, shows that the forest left behind in the wake of deforestation also suffers greatly. \u201cThis project I think more than any other demonstrated that forest fragmentation in patches was a very, very big problem for nature,\u201d said Harvey Locke, a conservationist and writer who visited Camp 41 with Lovejoy in December. \u201cYou never hear anybody seriously arguing now that several little patches are better than a big intact block.\u201d Walking through an isolated, nearly 25-acre forest fragment presents a stunning contrast with the forest near the harpy eagle\u2019s angelim tree. In the intact forest, it\u2019s dark and even relatively cool at the forest floor, a simple function of the fact that trees and vines, crowding upward, have managed to claim nearly all of the sunlight. But in the fragment, direct tropical sunlight penetrates much farther, not only from above but from every side. It\u2019s warmer as a result, and also drier \u2013 the layer of fallen leaves on the forest floor isn\u2019t wet and spongy, but crunches and crackles as you walk. This environment sustains less life \u2013 animals and plants alike. Spider monkeys, which need to range over a huge area, can\u2019t survive in a fragment like this, Lovejoy said. And they\u2019re one food source for the harpy eagle. \u201cWherever the forest has been altered or compromised, where hunting has reduced prey items, harpys are one of the first to suffer,\u201d said Bret Whitney, a specialist in Brazilian birds and a research associate at Louisiana State University who guided the recent trip to Camp 41 and identified the harpy eagle. \u201cThey really require an intact ecosystem to be out there.\u201d \u201cWe know that tree mortality went up in this fragment compared to continuous forest,\u201d Lovejoy said. The forest, when fragmented, \u201cbecomes simpler,\u201d he said. Winds also blow down more trees in fragments, Lovejoy\u2019s research suggests, another reason that they store less carbon. The punchline, then, isn\u2019t far from that of the movie Avatar: it\u2019s all connected. The climate, the trees, the animals living in the forest, and the carbon the forest stores. Indeed, recent research suggests that the poaching and killing of large forest animals like tapirs \u2013 another problem in the Amazon and around the world \u2013 also reduces the forest\u2019s carbon stock because these animals disperse the large seeds that in turn grow into the largest trees. Without them, you\u2019d have fewer angelims, and fewer of the other major canopy trees that dominate the tropical skyline, and that stand out if you get high enough to actually see them. And these problems certainly aren\u2019t confined to the Amazon. \u201cSeventy percent of the world\u2019s remaining forests are within 1 kilometer of a road,\u201d Lovejoy said. \u201cWhich is a measure of how advanced fragmentation is.\u201d <strong>Brazil\u2019s deforestation success story turns mixed</strong><br /> It\u2019s not that Brazil is indifferent to the problem of deforestation \u2013 it has recently been celebrated for making considerable progress on the problem. Between 1995 and 2005, it was losing over 7,500 square miles of forest per year on average. (That\u2019s more than one Connecticut per year). However, in 2013 it only lost about 2,255 square miles, a 70 percent reduction credited to greater enforcement of forest protections. Lately, though, the celebrations have died off a bit \u2013 deforestation in Brazil appears to have ticked up again somewhat in recent years, albeit for unclear reasons. Usually, it decreases with greater law enforcement and increases in stronger economies. But right now, with the Brazilian economy in the tank \u2013 the currency, the real, has plunged from being worth about half of a U.S. dollar in 2012-2013 to being worth only a quarter of one today \u2013 it\u2019s bucking both of these trends. \u201cRecently, you have high levels of enforcement, and low levels of economic activities, and an increase in deforestation,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Guimar\u00e3es, the executive director of Brazil\u2019s Amazon Environmental Research Institute. \u201cThat is striking us right now. We are still trying to understand what is going on.\u201d Brazil recently pledged to achieve \u201czero illegal deforestation in the Amazon by 2030,\u201d but that would still mean major deforestation between now and then. \u201cWhat they are saying is really incredible, that Brazil will coexist with illegalities in the forest sector by an additional 15 years,\u201d says Paulo Adario, the Manaus-based senior forest strategist for Greenpeace. And the problem of tropical deforestation is far broader than Brazil. The burning of Indonesia\u2019s tropical peatlands contributed more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than the vast majority of countries did from fossil fuels in 2015. And while Indonesia and Brazil remain the world\u2019s tropical forest loss leaders, other smaller nations like Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Madagascar are contributing more and more to the overall total, according to recent satellite data from the University of Maryland and Google. Other countries into which the Amazon rainforest extends, like Bolivia, Peru, and Venezuela, have also seen substantial deforestation in recent years. <strong>The dreaded feedback</strong><br /> A view above the Amazon forest canopy from a research tower on a wet December morning, meanwhile, underscores another disturbing problem closely tied to deforestation. Namely, even as the world tries to protect tropical forests, climate change itself could alter them further, causing them to store less carbon and triggering a feedback cycle of ever worsening warming as a result. As the sun rises after an intense rain, the trees of the Amazon \u2013 a splash of different shades of green \u2013 seem to collectively perspire. Vast clouds of water vapor rise off them, a phenomena Lovejoy says is driven both by countless leaves opening and closing their stomata (or pores) and letting water out, and also evaporation off of the forest. In this way the forest creates weather that fills the planet\u2019s largest river with water and also provides crucial rain across much of South America. The Amazon pulls in Atlantic moisture and then \u201cit gets recycled about five times as the air mass moves to the Andes,\u201d Lovejoy said. But now, he fears, the loss of forests is threatening this hydrological cycle \u2013 leaving too few trees to drive rains, a development underscored by droughts in 2005 and 2010. Deforestation could dry out the Amazon, but a warmer climate might do the same. The length of the dry season here is expected to increase due to climate change, and in fact, that already seems to be happening in some Amazon regions. And this, in turn, could not only threaten regional hydrology but push a transition to less carbon-dense forests \u2013 in some cases even exacerbating the possibility of wildfires that could transform tropical forests into a different, savannah-like environment. Thus, both continuing deforestation and a warming climate alike threaten the carbon storage, and the rain generation, of the vast Amazon system. It\u2019s not one menace \u2013 it\u2019s two that are closely intertwined. <strong>Forests become part of the climate story</strong><br /> The forests section of the recent Paris climate agreement wasn\u2019t one of the most noted or debated sections. And it wasn\u2019t as strong as some would have liked. But the mere fact that it was there was a landmark, Lovejoy said. \u201cHappily, forests are now part of the way the whole climate agenda is put together,\u201d he said, even though \u201cit may have been only a couple of paragraphs in Paris.\u201d The key change in tone may simply reflect the huge ambition of the Paris agreement \u2013 and its citation of the seemingly unattainable 1.5 degree temperature target in particular. With goals like these, it\u2019s becoming clear that the solution to climate change isn\u2019t any one thing. It\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck moment. The harpy eagle, glimpsed on two successive mornings in its giant tree, with its regal crest and powerful legs that Whitney says are \u201cas thick as a man\u2019s wrist,\u201d is no party to any of this. It\u2019s just trying to survive, and pursuing a strategy for doing so that evolved long before modern deforestation. It can\u2019t help needing very large trees and vast areas over which to hunt \u2013 so it can\u2019t help being a kind of symbol. But what\u2019s increasingly clear is that the birds, the forests and all of its other life, the rainfall, the carbon \u2013 they all come as a package. And what\u2019s equally clear is that climate change isn\u2019t just about temperature, or about fossil fuels. It\u2019s about all the ways that humans keep pushing gigantic systems like the Amazon, and hoping that they\u2019ll bounce back, just because they always have before. <b>More at Energy & Environment:</b> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/08/why-many-economists-support-obamas-idea-of-a-tax-on-oil/\">Why so many economists back Obama\u2019s idea of a tax on oil</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/10/the-supreme-court-could-block-obamas-climate-plans-but-it-cant-stop-clean-energy/\">The Supreme Court could block Obama\u2019s climate plans \u2014 but it can\u2019t stop clean energy</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/01/27/its-not-just-flint-poor-communities-across-the-country-live-with-extreme-polluters/\">It\u2019s not just Flint: Poor communities across the U.S. live with \u2018extreme\u2019 polluters</a> <em>For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter <a href=\"http://wapo.st/1MomKU6\">here</a>, and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/postgreen\">here</a>.</em> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 40010.0, "text": "Rio Negro", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Rio Negro (Amazon)", "entityid": 313921}, {"id": 40020.0, "text": "Peru", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Peru", "entityid": 170691}, {"id": 40030.0, "text": "Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute", "entityid": 1740608}, {"id": 40040.0, "text": "National Institute for Amazonian Research", "wiki_title": "enwiki:National Institute of Amazonian Research", "entityid": 3200848}, {"id": 40050.0, "text": "Paris", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Paris", "entityid": 22989}, {"id": 40060.0, "text": "Bolivia", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Bolivia", "entityid": 3462}, {"id": 40070.0, "text": "Andes", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Andes", "entityid": 1354}, {"id": 40080.0, "text": "Madagascar", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Madagascar", "entityid": 18964}, {"id": 40090.0, "text": "Paul Salaman", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Paul Salaman", "entityid": 23688468}, {"id": 40010.0, "text": "Sierra Leone", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Sierra Leone", "entityid": 27308}, {"id": 40011.0, "text": "Manaus", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Manaus", "entityid": 455086}, {"id": 40012.0, "text": "Louisiana State University", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Louisiana State University", "entityid": 277905}, {"id": 40013.0, "text": "South America", "wiki_title": "enwiki:South America", "entityid": 26769}, {"id": 40014.0, "text": "Brazilian", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Brazil", "entityid": 3383}, {"id": 40015.0, "text": "Google", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Google", "entityid": 1092923}, {"id": 40016.0, "text": "Nature Climate Change", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Nature Climate Change", "entityid": 41737459}, {"id": 40017.0, "text": "Greenpeace", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Greenpeace", "entityid": 12233}, {"id": 40018.0, "text": "Harvey Locke", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Harvey Locke", "entityid": 24312180}, {"id": 40019.0, "text": "Amazon", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Amazon rainforest", "entityid": 48139}, {"id": 40020.0, "text": "Thomas Lovejoy", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Thomas Lovejoy", "entityid": 31563}, {"id": 40021.0, "text": "Par\u00e1", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Par%C3%A1", "entityid": 31563}, {"id": 40022.0, "text": "Solim\u00f5es", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Solim%C3%B5es River", "entityid": 31563}, {"id": 40023.0, "text": "Connecticut", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Connecticut", "entityid": 6466}, {"id": 40024.0, "text": "Woods Hole Research Center", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Woods Hole Research Center", "entityid": 3163081}, {"id": 40025.0, "text": "United Nations", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United Nations", "entityid": 31769}, {"id": 40026.0, "text": "Rainforest Trust", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Rainforest Trust", "entityid": 14843219}, {"id": 40027.0, "text": "Earth", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Earth", "entityid": 9215}, {"id": 40028.0, "text": "Atlantic", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Atlantic Ocean", "entityid": 698}, {"id": 40029.0, "text": "George Mason University", "wiki_title": "enwiki:George Mason University", "entityid": 12566}, {"id": 40030.0, "text": "Global Environment Facility", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Global Environment Facility", "entityid": 367276}, {"id": 40031.0, "text": "Venezuela", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Venezuela", "entityid": 32374}, {"id": 40032.0, "text": "Mato Grosso", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mato Grosso", "entityid": 229514}, {"id": 40033.0, "text": "U.S.", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 40034.0, "text": "Cambodia", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Cambodia", "entityid": 334751}, {"id": 40035.0, "text": "Indonesia", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Indonesia", "entityid": 14579}]}

Based on satellite estimates of central pressure, Vongfong is now the most intense storm on Earth so far in 2014, and forecast models suggest it could rival the intensity of deadly Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 over the next 24 hours. During the 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday mornings, Vongfong ballooned from wind speeds of 89 mph to 168 mph, based on satellite estimates. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimates that Typhoon Vongfong has maximum winds of 155 mph on Tuesday morning, though this is likely a conservative estimate. Vongfong is now the sixth super typhoon of 2014, with winds speeds over 150 mph. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center points to a favorable environment for the cause of the rapid intensification, including low wind shear and excellent outflow, which helps to ventilate and strengthen the storm. Forecast models are suggesting that the super typhoon could continue to intensify, tanking to 895 millibars \u2014 a typhoon intensity not seen since Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed over 6,000 people. A pressure that low would beat this year\u2019s second most intense storm \u2014 Typhoon Genevieve \u2014 by 20 millibars. Luckily, this monster storm is not expected to make landfall while it\u2019s at such high intensity. Over the next 24 to 48 hours, Vongfong is forecast to make a sharp turn north toward Japan. By Saturday morning, the typhoon is forecast to weaken to the equivalent of a category three, and then a category two with wind speeds of 105 mph, as it approaches the southern islands of the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan. Beyond this, global forecast models are suggesting Vongfong will continue to turn northeast and potentially making landfall in the southern Japan mainland, which will undoubtedly bring torrential rain to a region already soaked from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/10/06/typhoon-phanfone-soaks-japan-typhoon-vongfong-next-in-line/\">Typhoon Phanfone</a>.

{"docId": "4192b016-8708-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3", "title": "Sugar tycoon Alfonso Fanjul now open to investing in Cuba under \u2018right circumstances\u2019", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "Alfonso Fanjul fled Cuba as a young man, leaving behind his family\u2019s mansions and vast sugar-cane fields as they were being wrested away by the communist Castro regime. In exile in the United States, he built an even larger sugar empire, amassing one of North America\u2019s great fortunes and befriending members of Congress and presidents who benefited from his largess. The sting of his family\u2019s forced departure from Cuba led him to become one of the principal funders of the U.S. anti-Castro movement. Now, contrary to what almost anyone could have imagined, the 76-year-old Fanjul has begun to reassess old grievances and tentatively eye Cuba as a place for him and other U.S. businessmen to expand their enterprises. Quietly, without fanfare, Fanjul has started visiting the island of his birth and having conversations with top Cuban officials. \u201cIf there is some way the family flag could be taken back to Cuba, then I am happy to do that,\u201d Fanjul said in a rare interview, publicly discussing his recent visits to the island for the first time. Fanjul\u2019s about-face is a startling development for the exile network that has held a grip on the politics of U.S.-Cuba relations for decades and has played an outsize role in presidential campaigns. His trips place him at the vanguard of a group of ultra-wealthy U.S. investors with roots on the island whose economic interests and political clout are pushing the two countries toward a thaw in their half-century standoff. Fanjul, in the interview, said repeatedly that his primary motivation in visiting Cuba has been a desire to \u201creunite the Cuban family,\u201d referring broadly to the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/losing-his-cuban-home-shaped-a-nat-geo-mapmakers-life/2014/01/30/358572e2-61b8-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f_story.html\">Cuban diaspora </a>and those who remain on the island. Business considerations could be explored only if there are political and diplomatic advances, he said. \u201cThe [Fanjul] family was in Cuba for 150 years, and, yes, at the end of the day, I\u2019d like to see our family back in Cuba, where we started. .\u2009.\u2009. But it has to be under the right circumstances,\u201d said Fanjul, who is best known by his nickname, \u201cAlfy.\u201d \u201cOne day we hope that the United States and Cuba would find a way so the whole Cuban community could be able to live and work together.\u201d Fanjul, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., and whose family holdings include Domino Sugar and refineries across the United States, Latin America and Europe, has managed to maintain a remarkably low profile for a politically connected tycoon. His access to the highest levels of power was evident during the Monica Lewinsky scandal of the 1990s, when the special prosecutor\u2019s report noted that President Bill Clinton received a call from Fanjul during a private Oval Office moment with the intern. Last week, the Fanjul family\u2019s influence over policymakers was on display when the U.S. House passed a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sugar-protections-prove-easy-to-swallow-for-lawmakers-on-both-sides-of-aisle/2013/12/07/f5959c06-5ac4-11e3-bf7e-f567ee61ae21_story.html\">farm bill that would cut subsidies to many agricultural products</a> while leaving unscathed the controversial, taxpayer-backed program that protects sugar profits. Fanjul visited Cuba in April 2012 and again in February 2013 as part of a delegation licensed through the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank that has produced recent papers criticizing U.S. policy and calling on the Obama administration to further loosen sanctions. In Havana, he lingered with tears in his eyes at his family\u2019s colonial-era manse, now a museum, with its elegant columns, lush inner courtyard, sparkling chandeliers and grand staircase. He was so taken by the nostalgia and excitement of returning to the familiar streets of his youth, a travel companion recalled, that Fanjul enthusiastically chatted up random people of all ages as he walked around. He also met with Cuba\u2019s foreign minister and toured state-run farms and a sugar mill with Cuban agricultural officials. Unlike most other Cuban Americans who travel to the island, Fanjul has direct access to some of America\u2019s most important policymakers. After returning from his first trip, Fanjul met with his good friend, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to express his changing views on Cuba. In November, Fanjul once again discussed his evolving mind-set with Clinton and her husband at a Clinton Foundation fundraiser in the Miami home of Cuban American businessman Paul Cejas, a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium. Many embargo supporters say U.S. policy should change only when certain conditions are met, such as regime change or political reforms. Fanjul, however, said he prefers not to answer the question of whether he would require the fall of the Castro government or an end to communism before doing business in Cuba \u2014 saying that he respects existing U.S. law. \u201cRight now there\u2019s no way for us to consider investing in Cuba. How can you work a deal if you\u2019re not legally allowed to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cNow, would we consider an investment at some later date?\u201d continued Fanjul, a permanent U.S. resident who maintains Spanish citizenship. \u201cIf there\u2019s an arrangement within Cuba and the United States, and legally it can be done and there\u2019s a proper framework set up and in place, then we will look at that possibility. We have an open mind.\u201d He said the Cuban government \u2014 which has business deals with companies from countries such as Canada and Spain \u2014 would have to change its economic structure to make it easier and safer for outside companies to make money. \u201cCuba has to presumably satisfy the requirements that investors need, which are primarily a return on investment and security of the investment, so they feel comfortable with what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally would look at that in the same framework as any investor would.\u201d The logistical, political and legal complexities involved in any potential expansion of U.S.-based businesses onto Cuban soil are staggering. Fanjul\u2019s willingness to hold meetings with the Castro government puts him on a potential collision course with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a Cuban American whose campaigns have been supported by Fanjul but who is an unwavering advocate for the embargo and has the power to thwart any attempts to lift it. Trickier still would be the impact on presidential politics, with Florida\u2019s Cuban American electorate still a significant factor in the battle for that state\u2019s crucial electoral college votes. Already, there have been signs that younger Cuban Americans, particularly those born in the United States, are moving away from the hard-line views of their parents and grandparents. Now, as Fanjul\u2019s recent gestures show, even some of the most entrenched exiles are evolving, and politicians accustomed to embracing the Cuba trade embargo in their pursuit of Florida\u2019s large Cuban American electorate will have to calibrate the risks and rewards of evolving along with them. Hillary Clinton, the putative Democratic front-runner for president if she chooses to run in 2016, spoke out in favor of the Obama administration\u2019s actions relaxing restrictions on family travel and cash flow to the island. Yet she, like many politicians in both parties, has repeatedly expressed support for continued sanctions. She is close with several key players, besides Fanjul, who have stated an openness to more engagement with Cuba. Fanjul, a longtime supporter of Bill Clinton\u2019s campaigns and causes, would probably be a major donor, as well as a close adviser on Cuba-related matters, to Hillary Clinton should she run. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a longtime Clinton confidant, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-mcauliffe-cuba-trip-to-promote-va-products-was-a-bust/2013/10/29/6710f3de-3677-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html\">traveled to Cuba for a trade mission in recent years</a> and held discussions with high-ranking government officials there. And Cejas, whom Bill Clinton appointed ambassador to Belgium, has expressed doubts about the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. \u201cI can tell you one thing that became very clear to me: The embargo is really an embargo against America ourselves. Because Americans cannot do business with Cuba, where there are incredible opportunities for growth,\u201d said Cejas, who traveled to Cuba with Fanjul. The issue could prove thornier for Republicans, such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a Cuban American widely seen as a possible 2016 presidential candidate. A staunch supporter of sanctions who <a href=\"http://www.rubio.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=330367\">blasted President Obama\u2019s loosening of some restrictions</a> as an \u201cenrichment of a Cuban regime that routinely violates the basic human rights and dignity of its people,\u201d Rubio has cited the Fanjul family as a crucial source of campaign funds and political connections. The family recently hosted another possible GOP presidential candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who headlined a Republican Governors Association reception last month at the Palm Beach home of Fanjul\u2019s nephew, Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Fanjul Jr., just as a scandal was erupting around Christie. The Fanjuls\u2019 internal family politics \u2014 Alfy backs Democrats and brother Pepe Sr. supports Republicans \u2014 reflect both the complexities of the Cuban American experience and perhaps the shrewdness of a family dynasty that knows how to hedge its bets. Asked about his brother\u2019s trips to Cuba, Pepe, in an e-mailed statement from his office, said he has \u201calways held firm that when the time comes and Cubans are reunited, I will return and help our fellow Cubans rebuild my birthplace.\u201d But, he added: \u201cAs you know, I have yet to return.\u201d In recent years, other prominent Cuban Americans have begun to talk more about opening relations with the island. A number of these exiles see Cuba, communist or not, as a potentially lucrative market that has been closed off to American corporations by decades-old trade barriers they helped erect. Now, some say, the long-standing embargo has failed. They say increased foreign investment in Cuba and greater engagement with people there could spur greater reforms. <b></b>But such suggestions have frequently been met with anger by the older generation of Cuban exiles. Miami businessman Carlos Saladrigas, for instance, said he has been openly branded a traitor in some circles because of his visits to Cuba and his interest in possibly changing U.S. policy. \u201cI used to be as hard-line as they come,\u201d said Saladrigas, a member of corporate boards for firms such as Duke Energy and Advance Auto Parts. But now he warns that U.S. businesses, without the ability to invest in Cuba, could find themselves sidelined if the island begins to open up. \u201cDo we as Cuban Americans, or do we as Americans, want to be left out of the picture?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can influence Cuba\u2019s future much more by participating in Cuba\u2019s future than by staying away.\u201d But the shift by Fanjul is far more significant. Not only do he and his family control one of the largest sugar operations in the world, but they also have been major donors to activist groups, such as the Cuban American National Foundation and the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, that have been vocal advocates for trade sanctions. Rumors of Fanjul\u2019s Cuba visit prompted Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Washington-based board member of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, to confront the sugar magnate during a recent private lunch in West Palm Beach. Claver-Carone said that he told Fanjul his trips had served only to help the Cuban regime. \u201cI told him they were using him as a tool,\u201d Claver-Carone said, \u201cand that with his stature comes responsibility.\u201d Fanjul\u2019s trips followed policy shifts by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has lost a number of its more conservative members amid its support for loosening restrictions on travel and money as a way to help Cubans living on the island. \u201cHaving known Alfy for 40 years, I think we can trust him to do the right thing,\u201d said Pepe Hernandez, president of the foundation. Fanjul said repeatedly during multiple interviews that \u201cthis is a highly sensitive issue.\u201d He said he needed to \u201cstay at a high altitude\u201d in discussing potential changes in U.S. policies toward Cuba because of the political challenges involved. \u201cWhat I say can be taken in the wrong context,\u201d he said. Fanjul\u2019s Brookings-organized trips coincided with calls by President Ra\u00fal Castro to rapidly revive Cuba\u2019s moribund sugar industry. Castro has begun permitting foreign companies to participate in sugar production for the first time since the 1959 revolution, and Brazilian firms would be likely candidates to seize new opportunities in Cuba. Fanjul said his visits were unrelated to Castro\u2019s sugar initiative. He said he has not met with Castro and held no specific discussions with Cuban officials about investments in Cuban sugar. Yet experts say there are many reasons that the Cubans would hope to entice the Fanjul family. \u201cThe Cuban government can revive its sugar industry only with an infusion of foreign investment,\u201d said American University professor Philip Brenner, an expert on the Cuban economy and politics. \u201cThe old Cuban mills are enormously inefficient, and the country needs modernization and mechanization to increase productivity.\u201d Investments by Brazilian sugar companies in Cuba put those companies in the back yard of the Fanjuls\u2019 operations, which dominate the Dominican Republic and Florida and have recently expanded into Mexico. Brenner, who regularly meets with Cuban officials, thinks the Cuban government may now \u201cbe willing to consider the possibility of permitting aging sugar barons\u201d from the United States to invest and participate. Fanjul joined the Brookings board this past July and has donated at least $200,000 to the think tank, which has hosted Cuban officials for panel discussions geared toward encouraging greater communication and loosened restrictions on doing business with Cuba. Ted Piccone, Brookings\u2019 acting vice president and foreign policy program director, wrote an open memo to Obama last month urging him to use his executive authority to give direct aid to entrepreneurs on the island and expand travel licenses. The memo did not mention Fanjul, but it said, \u201cThese measures would draw support from key political and business constituencies in the United States (including Florida).\u201d The Fanjul trips to Cuba reflect a broader, though still subtle, easing of Cold War-era tensions between the United States and the Castro regime. In recent months, U.S. and Cuban officials have engaged in small-scale diplomatic talks on issues such as immigration, drugs and offshore oil drilling. And Obama drew attention to the relationship in December when he shook hands with Castro at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela in South Africa. Obama hinted at a November fundraiser in Miami of more changes ahead when he said U.S. policy toward Cuba should be \u201ccreative\u201d and \u201cthoughtful.\u201d \u201cKeep in mind that when Castro came to power, I was just born,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Fanjul\u2019s own travel to the island gave him insights not only about business possibilities, he said, but other possibilities, too. \u201cDo I have a soft spot in my heart?

{"docId": "e9ba25a0-efe8-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4", "title": "Sen. Robert Menendez seeks probe of alleged Cuban plot to smear him", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "Sen. Robert Menendez is asking the Justice Department to pursue evidence obtained by U.S. investigators that the Cuban government concocted an elaborate plot to smear him with allegations that he cavorted with underage prostitutes, according to people familiar with the discussions. In a letter sent to Justice Department officials, the senator\u2019s attorney asserts that the plot was timed to derail the \u00adpolitical rise of Menendez (D-N.J.), one of Washington\u2019s most ardent critics of the Castro regime. At the time, Menendez was running for reelection and was preparing to assume the powerful chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to a former U.S. official with firsthand knowledge of government intelligence, the CIA had obtained credible evidence, including Internet protocol addresses, linking Cuban agents to the prostitution claims and to efforts to plant the story in U.S. and Latin American media. The alleged Cuba connection was laid out in an intelligence report provided last year to U.S. government officials and sent by secure cable to the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division, according to the former official and a second person with close ties to Menendez who had been briefed on the matter. The intelligence information indicated that operatives from Cuba\u2019s Directorate of Intelligence helped create a fake tipster using the name \u201cPete Williams,\u201d according to the former official. The tipster told FBI agents and others he had information about Menendez participating in poolside sex parties with underage prostitutes while vacationing at the Dominican Republic home of Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor, donor and friend of the senator. A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which functions as the island\u2019s U.S. diplomatic outpost, did not respond to requests for comment. The allegations against Menendez erupted in public in November 2012, when the Daily Caller, a conservative Web site, quoted two Dominican women claiming Menendez had paid them for sex. The FBI investigated the prostitution claims but was unable to corroborate them. Last year, three Dominican women who had initially claimed to reporters that they had been paid to have sex with Menendez <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/escort-says-menendez-prostitution-claims-were-made-up/2013/03/04/31299fe2-8514-11e2-999e-5f8e0410cb9d_story.html\">recanted</a> their story. Investigators in the Justice Department\u2019s public-integrity division continue to probe whether Menendez used his position to benefit Melgen\u2019s business interests, according to two people familiar with the inquiry. The April letter from Menendez\u2019s attorney to the Justice Department has not been made public. The attorney, Stephen M. Ryan, confirmed that he sent the letter but declined to comment on its contents. \u201cIt is deeply disturbing that a foreign government whose intelligence service is an enemy of the United States might try to influence U.S. foreign policy by discrediting an elected official who is an opponent of the Cuban regime,\u201d Ryan said. CIA spokesman Dean Boyd declined to comment. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and FBI declined to comment on whether their offices were made aware of the intelligence information or whether they took any actions as a result. There was no indication that the information gathered by U.S. intelligence officials alleging Cuba\u2019s role in the Menendez case had been fully investigated or proved. According to the former U.S. official familiar with the intelligence, the information suggested that Cuban operatives worked through business allies and lawyers in the Dominican Republic to create the fictitious tipster. The former official said the U.S. intelligence community obtained information showing that Cuban operatives allegedly attempted to lend credence to the timeline of the prostitution allegations by tracking flights on Melgen\u2019s private plane that Menendez made for visits to the elite Casa de Campo resort, where the eye doctor has a home. The FBI\u2019s investigation into the prostitution claims was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/grand-jury-investigating-sen-robert-menendez-d-nj-people-familiar-with-probe-say/2013/03/14/2eb4fad4-8b24-11e2-9838-d62f083ba93f_story.html\">part of the broader and more substantive Justice Department inquiry</a> into the Menendez-Melgen relationship. Menendez <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-menendez-contacted-top-officials-in-friends-medicare-dispute/2013/02/06/e01bf928-6fd4-11e2-aa58-243de81040ba_story.html\">twice intervened </a>with top federal health-care officials to dispute their agency\u2019s finding that Melgen had overbilled Medicare by $8.9 million for eye treatments at his clinics. The senator also urged top officials at the State and Commerce departments to use their influence over the Dominican Republic to enforce a port security contract for a company in which Melgen was part owner. The status of the larger probe is uncertain. But according to two people familiar with the investigation, the Justice Department\u2019s public-integrity section and FBI agents are actively pursuing the inquiry and eyeing possible charges against Menendez. If assertions of Cuban involvement in the prostitution claims were ever proved true, they would represent another flash point in a lengthy history of tensions between the United States and Cuba. In recent months, the U.S. Agency for International Development was forced to confirm the existence of a secret program to create a Twitter-like network in Cuba. The two nations have been at odds over the imprisonment in Havana of a USAID contractor, Alan Gross, accused by Cuba of spying, and they have clashed over the imprisonment of Cuban spies in the United States. Havana has sought to build support within the United States for ending the half-century trade embargo that has squelched development on the island. And increasingly, U.S. businesses seeking untapped new markets have been pushing to ease the sanctions. Last month, Thomas J. Donohue \u2014 president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a critic of Cuba sanctions \u2014 argued for more-open business relations between the countries after a visit to Havana. Some prominent Cuban American executives who have long backed the embargo have also begun to soften their stance, such as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sugar-tycoon-alfonso-fanjul-now-open-to-investing-in-cuba-under-right-circumstances/2014/02/02/4192b016-8708-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">sugar tycoon Alfonso Fanjul</a>, who revealed this year that he had visited the island and was open to doing business there someday. And President Obama, who has loosened some restrictions, has signaled a willingness to do more. But Menendez, with a long-hardened resolve and a key seat overseeing U.S. foreign policy, is perhaps the single most important obstacle to normalizing relations. Enrique Garcia Diaz, a former high-ranking Cuban spy official who defected and is now living in the United States, said in an interview that it was routine for Cuban intelligence officials to plant damaging news stories about opponents of the regime. \u201cFrom the moment that article about Senator Menendez was published, I suspected that it was an invention of Cuban intelligence, because that is the way they work. It is their modus operandi,\u201d he said. \u201cThey fabricate lies. They look to create intrigue.\u201d The Cuban government has previously sought to embarrass Menendez, according to a book by an FBI informant who worked undercover in Cuba. In \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597971898?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1597971898&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspos09-20\" title=\"www.amazon.com\">Ruse: Undercover with FBI Counterintelligence</a>,\u201d Robert Eringer wrote that the Cuban government <a href=\"http://archive.today/y8oxn\" target=\"_blank\">asked him to try to dig up unflattering information to \u201cexpose and humiliate\u201d Menendez.</a> Eringer said Cuban officials who approached him were \u201cobsessed\u201d with generating scandalous information about Menendez and other Cuban Americans in Congress who opposed normalized relations. The FBI\u2019s Miami field office began its probe into the Menendez prostitution allegations in August 2012 after receiving copies of e-mails that \u201cPete Williams\u201d sent to a liberal watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW said the tipster began corresponding with its investigators that spring, but they told the FBI they were unable to meet Williams in person or corroborate the claims. \u201cMy duty as a US citizen obligates me to report <a href=\"http://www.citizensforethics.org/page/-/PDFs/Legal/Investigation/Peter_Williams_Menendez_Emails.pdf?nocdn=1\" target=\"_blank\">what I consider a grave violation</a> of the most fundamental codes of conduct that a politician of my country must follow,\u201d the tipster, identified as Williams, wrote to CREW in an April 2012 e-mail, claiming \u201cfirst hand information\u201d about Menendez\u2019s participation in \u201cinappropriate sexual activities with young prostitutes.\u201d The <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/01/women-sen-bob-menendez-paid-us-for-sex-in-the-dominican-republic/\">allegations first became public</a> on Nov. 1, 2012, days before Menendez stood for reelection, with the Daily Caller reporting that two women said they had met Menendez around Easter that year at the Casa de Campo resort and that Menendez paid them for sex acts. ABC News said it was introduced to the women and their story by Republican operatives at the same time but <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/robert-menendez-prostitution-scandal-happened/story?id=18664472\" target=\"_blank\">decided against going with the story</a>, because the women appeared coached and were not able to provide identification cards. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-probing-allegations-sen-menendez-patronized-prostitutes-in-dominican/2013/02/15/49b64e7c-77c5-11e2-8f84-3e4b513b1a13_story.html\">FBI spent months</a> in 2012 and 2013 looking into the prostitution claims against Menendez, executing search warrants and sending multiple agents to the Dominican Republic to question people on the island, including Melgen\u2019s housekeeper and staff. But agents visiting strip clubs and Casa de Campo haunts that fall and winter never turned up evidence tying Menendez to prostitutes, two people familiar with the case said. They also were never able to link the \u201cPete Williams\u201d e-mails back to a real person. The FBI spokesman for the Miami field office, Michael Leverock, declined to comment for this article. Tucker Carlson, editor in chief of the Daily Caller, said in a phone interview that it would be a major shock to him if the Cuban government spooled out a story that his reporters ran with \u2014 but that it\u2019s also a hard claim for him to verify. \u201cI really can\u2019t assess it without more information,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre on its face, but also fascinating.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

Its death was foretold, yet somehow it still came as a shock. It didn\u2019t expire on a bayside battlefield in the Caribbean or with a mushroom cloud or even with an exploding cigar. It perished at a White House podium. The prisoner swap that set Alan Gross free \u2014 and the sweeping changes to U.S. policy on Cuba that went with it \u2014 won\u2019t heal all wounds, nor will it vanquish the powerful cold warriors in the U.S. Congress. But it did fundamentally alter a curio of American foreign policy that deeply influenced popular culture and played an outsize role in U.S. presidential politics for more than half a century. In April 1959, Richard Nixon was unimpressed with the bearded revolutionary in green fatigues who arrived at his office. Fidel Castro\u2019s \u201cideas as to how to run a government or an economy are less developed than those of almost any world figure I have met in fifty countries,\u201d Nixon, then the U.S. vice president, wrote in a memo declassified in 2001. Nixon distrusted the newly victorious Castro, whom he had correctly pegged as a communist, as did his boss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In the years to come, the Berlin Wall rose and fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. Nixon went to China. Yet the grudge match with Castro persisted, spanning 11 U.S. presidencies. It survived intact as a relic of the Cold War, which may have essentially ended in the 1990s but lived on in the dysfunctional relationship between the United States and Cuba. Dating back to the early days of his regime, killing Castro became the tragicomic obsession of a generation of American spies. If they couldn\u2019t get him with a combustible cigar, then they might consider offing him with a gift of a wet suit laced with tuberculosis or, perhaps, enlist the help of a mob hit man. Sometimes, however, the efforts to rid the island of Castro were just plain tragic. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration approved a poorly planned and poorly supported invasion at the Bay of Pigs. Castro demonstrated his brutality by executing nine of those who\u2019d plotted against him. It was a crushing blow to Cuban exiles in Florida who welcomed the coming of each new year with the toast \u201cNext year in Havana.\u201d The next year, instead of reunions on the island, they got the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Soviet missiles were spotted in Cuba, and it took extraordinary diplomatic gymnastics to avert an apocalyptic conflict between the superpowers. Castro\u2019s seemingly eternal squabble with the United States evolved into the central animating force of Cuban political discourse during his years as president and remained there once he gave over titular control of the country to his brother Ra\u00fal after falling ill in 2006. Rather than accept blame for mismanaging the Cuban economy and for the startling decay of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, the Castros were forever pointing at the U.S. trade embargo. (Even though the embargo remains in place, Obama\u2019s policy shift is designed to increase commerce between the nations by expanding U.S. exports and banking links.) Fidel Castro\u2019s repression of free speech, jailing of political prisoners, refusal to hold elections, travel restrictions and almost total ban on private enterprise have made thousands of Cubans desperate to leave. On the streets of Havana, people talk of escaping to \u201cLa Yuma,\u201d Cuban slang for the United States that most likely derived from the 1950s Western \u201c3:10 to Yuma.\u201d The reference to a long-ago film only reinforces the impression of Havana as existing in a time warp, where classic U.S. cars share roads with clunky Soviet junkers, and where every Cuban driver has to be a mechanic. In the provinces, they don\u2019t even have the luxury of broken-down cars; many people have to get around in horse-drawn carriages or walk. To get to La Yuma, Cubans have been willing to do almost anything, including risking death. They\u2019ve pushed into the sea on rafts and inner tubes and surfboards, anything they could find. They\u2019ve arrived on makeshift boats made from tractors and old tires. In one unforgettable escape attempt, a Cuban family tried to get to Florida in a fantastically conceived watercraft fashioned from a green 1951 Chevy truck. Tens of thousands came in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, crowding into temporary housing at the Orange Bowl in Miami while Castro boasted that by allowing them to leave, he had \u201cflushed the toilets\u201d of Cuba. A succession of U.S. governments tried to make it easier for Cubans to come to the United States. In the mid-1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration instituted the Cuban Adjustment Act, which aids Cuban migrants in becoming permanent residents after being admitted to the United States. Clinton would expand the opportunities for Cuban migrants by putting in place a \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy in which Cuban migrants who are caught at sea are usually sent back to the island, while those who make it to land are usually allowed to stay. Some of the most in\u00adtrac\u00adtable disputes between the United States and Cuba can be traced to the waters of the 90 miles of the Florida Straits. In 1996, two planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an exile group that assisted rafters, were shot down above the straits after what the Cuban government claimed was an intrusion in its airspace. Four men died, and with them went the hopes of would-be Cuba-policy reformers who were optimistic that then-President Bill Clinton would loosen sanctions on the island. Nearly four years later, the mother of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez drowned while fleeing Cuba, setting off an epic custody battle that ended with the 6-year-old being wrenched from the home of Miami relatives by gun-toting federal agents and sent back to his father and Cuba. Thousands of Cuban migrants are believed to have died trying to enter the United States by sea. Through the tragedies, a certain mystique about Cuba has been magnified by its inaccessibility. American tourists slipped onto the island, evading U.S. restrictions by flying to Havana via Mexico or Jamaica and then pleading with Cuban airport personnel not to stamp their passports. Making it out with a box or even a handful of Montecristo cigars or a bottle of Havana Club rum, for some, was a feat worth bragging about. But many exiles viewed such trips as unforgivable betrayals that helped an oppressive government by pumping hard currency into its beleaguered economy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pressed to expand options for U.S. businesses in Cuba. And investors have looked longingly at the island, as Spanish and Canadian firms have established footholds in a place with vast tracts of undeveloped beachfront, scuba-diving Edens and outmoded, inefficient farms. The Cuban American sugar baron Alfonso \u201cAlfy\u201d Fanjul \u2014 a major backer of anti-Castro exile groups \u2014 recently said he would be interested in exploring business opportunities on the island. His remarks, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sugar-tycoon-alfonso-fanjul-now-open-to-investing-in-cuba-under-right-circumstances/2014/02/02/4192b016-8708-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html\">published in January in The Washington Post</a>, set Cuba watchers aflame with speculation that major changes in U.S. policy might be coming. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) accused Fanjul of trying to make a deal with \u201cthe devil.\u201d \u201cAt a time when the democracy activists on the island are facing even harsher reprisals from the brutal Cuban regime, it\u2019s pathetic that a Cuban American tycoon feels inspired to trample on the backs of those activists in order to give the communist thugs more money with which to repress,\u201d Ros-Lehtinen said at the time. Popular culture has been impervious to the political disputes. It\u2019s almost impossible to walk onto a college campus in the United States or Europe without seeing Alberto Korda\u2019s famous photo of Che Guevara, titled \u201cEl Guerrillero Heroico,\u201d or \u201cThe Heroic Guerrilla.\u201d The New Year\u2019s Eve scene in \u201cGodfather II\u201d probably educated more Americans about the victory of the Castro revolution than any schoolbook. And Woody Allen sent up the Cuban revolution in his spoof \u201cBananas.\u201d But farce might be the hardest genre to pull off because the reality of U.S.-Cuba relations is often so quirky. This year, the Associated Press figured out that the U.S. Agency for International Development had sought to trigger a youth uprising, a sort of Cuban Spring, by setting up a phony, Twitter-like network in Cuba called \u201cZunZuneo,\u201d a Cuban slang term for the sound of a hummingbird. More recently, AP revealed that USAID had hired a Serbian music promoter to infiltrate Cuba\u2019s hip-hop scene in hopes of sparking youth protests against the Castro government. And the United States has spent tens of thousands of dollars a year to maintain a plane that is supposed to broadcast American television programming in Cuba but never flies because of a budget stalemate. In the meantime, Fidel Castro revealed a few years back that he has been collecting annual rent checks from the U.S. government for the use of Guantanamo, the U.S. base on the island, for half a century. But, in protest of U.S. policies, he says his cash-strapped government has only cashed one of the $4,000 checks in all those years \u2014 and that was by accident. For years, the two nations conducted an odd propaganda war, one-upping each other, in front of the building that houses the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, along the city\u2019s scenic seawall, known as the Malecon. U.S. officials angered Castro by putting up a Christmas display that included a large \u201c75\u201d \u2014 a reference to the number of dissidents arrested in an early 2000s crackdown. Castro responded by erecting big signs showing images of U.S. abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Two years later, the United States infuriated Cuban officials by installing a digital sign that scrolled news reports and provocative quotes in five-foot-tall letters on the side of the building. On a typical day, there were would be news items containing information such as the stats of a Cuban defector playing in the major leagues or a U.S. magazine naming Fidel Castro one of the world\u2019s wealthiest heads of state (the Cuban leader claims to have no personal wealth). And once there was a quip from the comedian George Burns: \u201cHow sad that all the people who would know how to run this country are driving taxis or cutting hair.\u201d The Castro government responded by installing 148 giant flagpoles in the park outside the building, making it almost impossible to see the scrolling news display. In 2009, U.S. officials in Havana quietly had the sign removed as Obama was beginning to loosen restrictions on travel to Cuba. Now people look for another type of sign: the departure board at Miami International Airport. It\u2019s filling with flights leaving for Havana. "}], "saliency": []}

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) released her statement in the wake of a Washington Post report quoting Fanjul as expressing an \u201copen mind\" to investing in Cuba \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201d Her reaction shows how emotional and polarized the politics of U.S.-Cuba relations remain -- so much so that a lawmaker feels the need to lash out at one of the giants of American industry (and one whose family gives millions in donations to both parties). The Fanjuls own one of the world\u2019s largest sugar empires -- growing, processing and refining cane sugar across the United States, Latin America and Europe. It is impossible to overstate the importance of Fanjul and his brother Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Fanjul to both parties. Alfonso, known as \u201cAlfy,\u201d is a major Democratic donor and fundraiser and is close with both Clintons. Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), look to the family for support, as well. Gov. Chris Christie headlined a reception in the midst of his scandal last month at the home of Alfy\u2019s nephew, Pepe Jr. Now, the family patriarch is taking a risky stand in his community. And all the 2016 White House hopefuls from both parties will have to decide whether they are ready to evolve with him on an issue that, as Ros-Lehtinen\u2019s statement suggests, still drives votes and conversation in one of Florida\u2019s most important electorates. Rubio, for instance, the son of Cuban immigrants, has attacked those who want to engage more with Castro for \u201cenabling\u201d a corrupt regime to get richer. But now the very policies he espouses are being rejected by at least one prominent member of a family that Rubio credits with raising crucial resources for his 2010 Senate bid. The attack from Ros-Lehtinen was surprisingly personal. The chairwoman of the subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa called Fanjul\u2019s actions \u201cshameful for a Cuban-American who fled the Castro regime.\u201d \u201cAt a time when the democracy activists on the island are facing even harsher reprisals from the brutal Cuban regime, it's pathetic that a Cuban-American tycoon feels inspired to trample on the backs of those activists in order to give the communist thugs more money with which to repress,\u201d she said. Fanjul traveled to the island with two groups organized by the Brookings Institution. In a rare interview, he told The Post that his primary goal was to find ways to unite the \u201cCuban family,\u201d referring broadly to those who live on the island and people of Cuban heritage who live now in Florida and elsewhere. He said he has not spoken with Cuban officials directly about investing in their country but <a href=\"(http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sugar-tycoon-alfonso-fanjul-now-open-to-investing-in-cuba-under-right-circumstances/2014/02/02/4192b016-8708-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html?hpid=z1)\">discussed the conditions under which he might consider it at some point</a>. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">\u201cRight now there\u2019s no way for us to consider investing in Cuba. How can you work a deal if you\u2019re not legally allowed to do it?\u201d he said.</span> \u201cNow, would we consider an investment at some later date?\u201d continued Fanjul, a permanent U.S. resident who maintains Spanish citizenship. \u201cIf there\u2019s an arrangement within Cuba and the United States, and legally it can be done and there\u2019s a proper framework set up and in place, then we will look at that possibility. We have an open mind.\u201d He said the Cuban government \u2014 which has business deals with companies from countries such as Canada and Spain \u2014 would have to change its economic structure to make it easier and safer for outside companies to make money. \u201cCuba has to presumably satisfy the requirements that investors need, which are primarily a return on investment and security of the investment, so they feel comfortable with what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally would look at that in the same framework as any investor would.\u201d Many observers said Fanjul\u2019s willingness to engage with Cuba reflected a changing landscape in the Cuban American community, where many are taking a more pragmatic view that the only way to democratize the island is to foster more contact with the people who live there. The president of the formerly hard-line Cuban American National Foundation, Pepe Hernandez, told The Post that he trusted Fanjul to do the right thing and supported his efforts. The question is whether Fanjul\u2019s willingness to speak out -- along with similar moves by other Cuban exile investors -- will push  the conversation to a new place. If even the Fanjul family, which directly suffered losses to the Castro regime, is willing to look anew at Cuba, then lawmakers and candidates might feel more comfortable -- or even compelled -- to evolve, as well.

We should not ignore the systemic violations of human rights in Cuba for the sake of opening up new business opportunities.\u201d</span> The statement from Rubio, who has credited the Fanjul family with raising money and helping him establish political connections during a critical time in his 2010 Senate race, was far more muted than the angry reactions that have come over the past day from two of his fellow Cuban American lawmakers. His softer tone illustrates the awkward position for Rubio, a Cuban American who has staked out a hard-line, pro-sanctions position on Cuba but who relies on the Fanjuls\u2019 campaign donations and fundraising clout. Fanjul is a Democratic donor and likely ally of Hillary Clinton should she run for president in 2016. But if Rubio runs for the Republican presidential nomination, Fanjul\u2019s brother, Pepe Sr., a donor to GOP causes, would likely play a key fundraising role behalf of his fellow Cuban American. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) said Fanjul\u2019s actions were \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cpathetic,\u201d while Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) called them a \u201cbetrayal.\u201d In the interview with The Post, Fanjul stopped short of declaring all-out opposition to the trade embargo. But he looked forward to a time that the embargo no longer existed and did not make the fall of the Castro regime a condition for him to do business there. The sugar magnate, who left Cuba as a young man and became a key funder of anti-Castro causes, said his primary goal was to \u201cunite the Cuban family.\u201d He said he was open to investing in Cuba if U.S. law were to change and if he and other investors could be guaranteed a reasonable rate of return. Fanjul said he traveled to Cuba twice \u2013 in April 2012 and February 2013 \u2013 and had high-level meetings with Cuban government officials. He toured an old sugar mill that had been built, he said, by Russians under the Castro regime. And he associated himself with recent reports by the Brookings Institution, which organized the trips, calling for a dramatic loosening of sanctions. Fanjul sits on the Brookings board and has donated at least $200,000 to the think tank in recent years. His visits to Cuba, combined with his openness to doing business there, was enough to set off a political bomb of sorts in Cuban American politics.

So it's somewhat remarkable that there was only one fatality on the police side of the showdown: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PNationale/status/666915776167677952\" target=\"_blank\">Diesel, a 7-year-old Belgian Malinois police dog</a> who was sent into the apartment at one point to check for survivors. The dog was killed when one of the people in the apartment detonated a suicide vest. Diesel's death sparked <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34861540\" target=\"_blank\">a popular hashtag</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Je-suis-Diesel-1012371842135825/\" target=\"_blank\">outpouring of respect and grief</a> on social media. And it highlighted the role specially trained dogs play in often dangerous law enforcement situations in France, as well as right here in the United States. It's unclear exactly how many police dogs are active in the United States. Jim Watson, director of the <a href=\"http://www.napwda.com/\" target=\"_blank\">North American Police Work Dog Association</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/09/police_dogs_are_sought-after_c.html\" target=\"_blank\">gave a \"wild guess\" of around 50,000 dogs</a> in 2010. The dogs are deployed to various domestic law enforcement agencies, doing everything from <a href=\"http://lakeexpo.com/news/lake_news/camden-sheriff-s-explosives-dog-finds-homemade-bomb-in-car/article_fb0d20d6-46a0-11e5-81d8-c7eb86ad546d.html\" target=\"_blank\">bomb-</a> and <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-hampton-drug-arrest-1111-20151110-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">drug-sniffing</a> to <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/one-suspect-shot-two-in-custody-and-tampa-police-hunting-for-a-fourth/2251265\" target=\"_blank\">chasing down suspected criminals</a>. And, unfortunately, police dog work can sometimes be deadly. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks police fatalities in the line of duty, includes numbers on <a href=\"http://www.odmp.org/k9\" target=\"_blank\">police dog fatalities</a> as well. Their numbers show that in 2015 so far, 26 police dogs have been killed in the line of duty \u2014 a number that's up sharply over the previous two years. In the most recent incident they've tracked, a dog named Hyco with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina was <a href=\"http://www.wyff4.com/news/deputies-respond-to-possible-carjacking-near-anderson-county-school/35963248\" target=\"_blank\">shot and killed while chasing a group of suspected carjackers</a>. In September, a police dog named Ike in Washington state was <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/story/news/2015/09/01/vancouver-police-k-9-stabbed-rushed-emergency-vet/71553360/\" target=\"_blank\">stabbed multiple times</a> while attempting to subdue a suspect and had to be euthanized due to the extent of his injuries. But while a number of dogs have died at the hands of a suspected criminal this year, the ODMP's numbers show that canine officers face an even bigger threat: heat exhaustion, particularly from being left in a squad car on a hot day. This year alone at least 11 dogs died from heat exhaustion, according to the ODMP. In August, two dogs with the Baltimore City Detention Center <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-corrections-dogs-deaths-20150831-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">died when the air conditioning failed</a> in a vehicle they were in. In Florida, an officer was suspended without pay in May when he inadvertently <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/hialeah/article34387554.html\" target=\"_blank\">left two police dogs</a> in a car at his home. The heat deaths \"happen at a pretty alarming rate,\" said Steve Weiss, an NYPD lieutenant who serves as ODMP's Director of Research. \"I was surprised by how often it happens.\" Weiss says that many K9 unit vehicles are now being outfitted with <a href=\"http://www.radiotronics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">electronic systems</a> that automatically regulate heat and humidity. <a href=\"http://www.rayallen.com/product/f-series-k-9-deployment-and-heat-alert-systems/K-9-Transport\" target=\"_blank\">Some systems</a> can alert remote officers if the AC fails or the temperature gets too high, and allow them to immediately pop the trunk or doors to allow dogs to escape. More widespread adoption of these systems would cut down on the heat exhaustion deaths, according to Weiss. Weiss says better laws protecting police dogs would help too. \"The laws in many states involving the deaths of police animals are not very strict,\" he said. \"Every state is different.\" <em>Update: This piece has been updated to reflect that authorities <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/20/path-of-french-female-suicide-bomber-showed-little-signs-of-islamic-extremism/\" target=\"_blank\">do not currently believe</a> the woman in the apartment, Hasna Aitboulahcen, detonated the suicide vest.</em> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 42610.0, "text": "Washington state", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Washington (state)", "entityid": 964505}, {"id": 42620.0, "text": "Belgian", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Belgium", "entityid": 3343}, {"id": 42630.0, "text": "Anderson County", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Anderson County, South Carolina", "entityid": 91906}, {"id": 42640.0, "text": "French", "wiki_title": "enwiki:France", "entityid": 10545}, {"id": 42650.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 42660.0, "text": "Baltimore City Detention Center", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Baltimore City Detention Center", "entityid": 41937691}, {"id": 42670.0, "text": "Paris", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Paris", "entityid": 22989}, {"id": 42680.0, "text": "Florida", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Florida", "entityid": 18933066}, {"id": 42690.0, "text": "NYPD", "wiki_title": "enwiki:New York City Police Department", "entityid": 255413}, {"id": 42610.0, "text": "ODMP", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Officer Down Memorial Page", "entityid": 7361445}, {"id": 42611.0, "text": "South Carolina", "wiki_title": "enwiki:South Carolina", "entityid": 27956}]}

According to an expert answer on the University of California at Santa Barbara ScienceLine, \u201d \u2026 doctors collect information after events like the 1999 solar eclipse, when people who stared directly at the sun for several minutes went to see their doctor. In one study, about half had permanent damage.\u201d An assessment after the same eclipse in Britain found fewer cases than they had feared, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7208/469.1.full\">but 14 people still managed to damage their eyes</a> by staring at the eclipse. There\u2019s even a tale that Isaac Newton stared at the sun with one eye (for the sake of science, of course), and afterward he could only see reds and blues. I have no idea if that is fiction or fact, but it sure makes a good story. <strong>Want to watch the eclipse safely? Here\u2019s how it will go \u2026</strong> <strong>\u2026 if you\u2019re in the path of totality:</strong> It will start as a partial eclipse as the moon begins to cover the sun. Keep your glasses on at this point. When the sun is totally blocked by the moon, you can take your glasses off! Enjoy. It\u2019s beautiful. Once sunlight starts to appear again, as the moon departs, put your glasses back on and enjoy the partial eclipse. <strong>\u2026 if you\u2019re not in the path of totality:</strong> You\u2019ll only be seeing a partial eclipse. There will be harmful sun rays for the duration of the event. <em>Keep your eclipse glasses on</em> through the whole thing. Yes, you will go blind if you manage to endure the pain and stare at the sun for long enough. The pain from the visible part of the light spectrum could be extreme, but ultraviolet light \u2014 which we can\u2019t see \u2014 can also damage the eye. It literally gives your eye a sunburn. The reason a few people always end up going blind during an eclipse is that in the partial phase, the visible light is reduced enough that it\u2019s no longer painful or uncomfortable to look at and so people assume it\u2019s safe. But depending on the sky conditions, it only takes about a minute and a half for your eyes to be permanently damaged, and the damage is cumulative, meaning you don\u2019t have to stare at the sun without looking away for it to be harmful \u2014 you may just be taking quick glances, but it\u2019s still damaging your eye. If your eyes are damaged, your vision will at least be blurry and you may see dark or yellow spots. If it\u2019s significant damage, you may not be able to see out of the center of your eye \u2014 only your peripheral vision. Other things you should be aware of: Some drugs dilate your pupils, which will decrease the amount of time it will take to burn the eye. People taking these drugs should always take care to wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Also, looking through a camera lens or a telescope will not protect your eyes. The latter is blatantly obvious in the video. Unless it has a filter on it that is made specifically for blocking out the harmful rays, you should not look through any lenses. <em>This story has been altered to make it clearer that both visible and U.V. light can damage the eye, albeit different parts of the eye.</em> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 42710.0, "text": "Isaac Newton", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Isaac Newton", "entityid": 14627}, {"id": 42720.0, "text": "Britain", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United Kingdom", "entityid": 31717}, {"id": 42730.0, "text": "University of California at Santa Barbara", "wiki_title": "enwiki:University of California, Santa Barbara", "entityid": 211917}, {"id": 42740.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}]}
{"docId": "159e6f9e-8e84-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb", "title": "Defining cool, from Walt Whitman and James Dean to Steve Jobs and Tony Hawk", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "Cultural concepts are always fuzzy, but that doesn\u2019t make them useless. We may never know the exact beginning or end of Romanticism or the Gilded Age, or where lies the line between art and entertainment, or what distinguishes great talent from genius. But that doesn\u2019t make those concepts hollow, just fluid and approximate. A new entertaining and insightful exhibition at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery confronts one of the most dynamic and hard to define concepts in American cultural life \u2014 the cool. \u201cAmerican Cool\u201d broaches its subject through photographs of people who helped define and embody the cool since before the idea had even taken definite form, to the current day when it is highly questionable if the \u201ccool\u201d is still meaningful. If you want to know how porous the category is, consider all of the following, officially inducted into the realms of the cool by this exhibition: Walt Whitman, Frederick Douglass, H.L. Mencken, Buster Keaton, Jackson Pollock and Susan Sontag. They join artists, entertainers and celebrities who are more traditionally and obviously defined as cool: Lester Young (who plays the central historical role in defining and promoting the idea of cool), Humphrey Bogart (the first and greatest mass-market embodiment of the cool) and Jack Kerouac (who helped export the cool from jazz to broader countercultural application). To govern what seems at first like a highly subjective free-for-all, curators Joel Dinerstein and Frank H. Goodyear III laid down a four-part test for each of the 100 people included. First, they must have made an original artistic contribution, with a signature style; second, they must have in some way been rebellious or transgressive; third, they must have iconic status; and fourth, they must have left a significant cultural legacy. But even those parameters can\u2019t contain the many things we think are definitional about the cool, the aura of mystery, the stoical indifference to criticism, the attitude of self- possession, and seemingly superficial yet important questions of dress and personal style. In a catalog essay accompanying the exhibition, Dinerstein piles on with yet more things that are the opposite of cool: \u201cTo be cool is not to be nice or good or heroic; cool is the opposite of innocence or virtue. Cool has an edge and a dark side: to be cool is not to strive to be fabulous <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> or saintly.\u201d Dinerstein is, among other things, a scholar of jazz, and Goodyear has a degree in American studies, and so they present the cool as essentially a pop culture phenomenon, and distinctly American. Other cultures have similar ideas \u2014 nonchalance, sangfroid, sprezzatura \u2014 but they are not \u201ccool.\u201d Sprezzatura dates back to Castiglione\u2019s \u201cBook of the Courtier,\u201d which prized a seemingly effortless virtuosity in all things, from art to social behavior. Sangfroid is distinctly French, a sense of composure and equilibrium, especially under fire. These are, according to the curators, concepts derived from aristocratic entitlement, whereas American cool is generally working class, an \u201cearned individuality\u201d rather than an inherited sense of self-worth. Perhaps, though the aristocratic definition of these ideas was breaking down around the same time that this exhibition posits the origins of the cool. Walt Whitman \u2014 the first personality featured in the exhibition, which calls him \u201cthe guiding light of American bohemia\u201d \u2014 published \u201cLeaves of Grass\u201d in 1855; in 1844, Alexandre Dumas began serializing \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo,\u201d in which a self-made working-class young man assumes an aristocratic name and character to exact revenge on his enemies. Few characters in literature are more suave, self-possessed, disciplined, eccentric and alluring \u2014 in a word, cool. And none of that was technically inherited. But the authors have a point. In America, at least, cool is distinctly lower or middle class, reflecting its origins in African American culture, where it was a compensation mechanism for living under the brutal regime of racism. When Lester Young said \u201cI\u2019m cool,\u201d writes Dinerstein, \u201cit meant \u2018I\u2019m keeping it together in here against invasive social forces.\u2019\u201d Frederick Douglass, whose oratory was fiery, not cool, merits inclusion in the exhibition because, according to Goodyear, he used a carefully constructed photographic identity to challenge preconceptions about race and African American men. \u201cThough he lived prior to cool\u2019s popularization, his cultivation of this mask of stylish stoicism presaged the rebellions of others who sought to live within yet also apart from the mainstream.\u201d Stylish stoicism is an excellent phrase. But as the exhibition charts the historical evolution of the cool, \u201cstylish stoicism\u201d fits less well with the later, countercultural appropriation of the cool. Transgression becomes more important than style and talent, even directionless, purposeless, self-destructive transgression. When Marlon Brando\u2019s character in the 1953 film \u201cThe Wild One\u201d is asked \u201cHey, Johnny, what are you rebelling against?\u201d and he answers, \u201cWhaddaya got?\u201d \u2014 the cool has clearly gone through a critical permutation. Brando is, of course, featured in the exhibition, looking sad, innocent and distracted in a 1950 image by Philippe Halsman. The exhibition situates this evolution of the cool in the period from 1960 t0 1979, but it was clearly nascent earlier than that. \u201cCool & Counterculture: 1960-1979\u201d is one of the most fascinating and provocative stretches of the show, including diverse figures from Andy Warhol and Paul Newman to Jack Nicholson and Bill Murray. One particularly evocative juxtaposition places a reprint of a 1966 photograph of Muhammad Ali with his fist thrust directly into the camera lens next to a 1971 image of Clint Eastwood, holding an enormous handgun in a visually analogous confrontation with the viewer. Clearly the concept has become elastic if it can encompass a black boxer playfully enacting an aggressive identity and a white actor appealing to working class (and often racist) fantasies of public order and vigilantism. The exhibition ends with what it calls \u201cThe Legacies of Cool: 1980-present.\u201d Here we find David Byrne (definitely cool), Steve Jobs (geek cool), Willie Nelson (long-haired, hippie stoner cool) and Jon Stewart (really?). Perhaps the most telling image is a photograph of skateboarder Tony Hawk, doing a move in his kitchen. His young son sits at the kitchen counter while his wife cradles a baby. The dishwasher is open, there are decorative plates above the standard-issue wooden cupboards and the whole thing screams suburbia. The wall text notes his success as an entrepreneur, with a popular line of sports equipment and a video game series. In an interview Dinerstein acknowledged that old ideas about transgression may not be so important any more. What matters now is \u201cnew strategies for individuality.\u201d The exhibition is heavily focused on celebrity, though there are some surprises (the Hawaiian surfer Duke Paoa Kahanamoku appears in a circa 1915 photograph). But as the concept of the cool becomes more and more open-ended, it\u2019s unfortunate that it isn\u2019t extended further beyond popular music and film. Susan Sontag definitely seems a worthy inclusion, but are there no classical musicians, ballet dancers or post-structuralist philosophers who are cool? Was the great violinist Jascha Heifetz cool? Or just cold? Was the literary theorist Jacques Derrida cool? Or just inscrutable? It\u2019s also unfortunate that the cool isn\u2019t treated more critically as a concept. There is a dark side of cool, dumb, impassive, disengaged, dismissive and even violent (see the oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino). Think of the phrase \u201ctoo cool for school,\u201d and all that implies. Although \u201cgeek\u201d cool makes a brief appearance in the person of Jobs (on a motorcycle), the rise of geeks and nerds as positive cultural archetypes may be a sign of a healthy resistance against the stupid underbelly of cool. As much as this exhibition celebrates the American invention and export of cool, one might argue that the fetish for cool is really just a sign of our overwhelmingly narcissistic provincialism. Dinerstein and Goodyear would, no doubt, argue strenuously with all that, as a misinterpretation of the concept. But again, that\u2019s the beauty and appeal of cultural concepts: They are as useful as they are spongy, and all the more fascinating for their essential fluidity. <i></i> <strong> </strong> \u201cAmerican Cool\u201d opens at the National Portrait Gallery on Friday.

Dean was breaking in the convertible\u2019s engine on the open highway before competing at a Salinas racetrack. Hallowed locations where Dean alighted that day loom like Stations of the Cross in the imagination of \u201cDeaners\u201d: the Porsche dealership, the Farmers Market in Los Angeles, a rest stop on old Route 466 called Blackwells Corner. Between essays describing such dots on the California map and straight-faced debate over whether the star of \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d really did stop in Santa Clarita for a glass of milk, Greenberg intersperses interviews with visitors to Dean\u2019s headstone in the Fairmount, Ind., cemetery or to the glistening memorial sculpture in Cholame, Calif., financed by a worshipful Japanese businessman. We encounter local history mavens, Dean \u201cDeath Ride\u201d reenactors and perennial contestants in Dean look-alike face-offs. Many say they are motivated by bromides attributed to Dean, such as \u201cDream as if you\u2019ll live forever; live as if you\u2019ll die today.\u201d Greenberg\u2019s favorite peripheral character in this opus is Rolf W\u00fctherich, the gifted German mechanic who customized the Spyder\u2019s engine and rode with Dean in the doomed roadster as they barreled across the San Joaquin Valley. After colliding head-on with a Ford Tudor, the Spyder flipped over multiple times, ejecting W\u00fctherich so that he landed, barely alive, next to its driver\u2019s side. Dean\u2019s body came to rest slumped over the passenger door. Henceforth, speculation led zealous fans to accuse W\u00fctherich of being the driver in the accident that robbed the world of Dean. Greenberg chronicles the misfortunes besetting W\u00fctherich until his own fatal crash in 1981. The mangled Spyder became a roadshow to encourage highway safety, but in Greenberg\u2019s telling, it could scarcely be transported between exhibitions without killing or maiming anyone who touched it. Greenberg draws parallels with another ill-fated historical vehicle, the Gr\u00e4f & Stift transporting Archduke Franz Ferdinand when he was assassinated in 1914, and inclines a grave ear to rumors that the Porsche company incorporated salvaged steel from the Gr\u00e4f & Stift into Dean\u2019s 550 Spyder. \u201cToo Fast to Live\u201d carefully presents much additional interesting trivia but sadly adds nothing to what we know about Dean. <b></b>Holley is the author of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312132492?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0312132492&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspos09-20\" title=\"www.amazon.com\">James Dean: The Biography</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786415525?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0786415525&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspos09-20\" title=\"www.amazon.com\">Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip.</a>\u201d <i>Read more</i>: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/defining-cool-from-walt-whitman-and-james-dean-to-steve-jobs-and-tony-hawk/2014/02/05/159e6f9e-8e84-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Defining cool, from Walt Whitman to James Dean</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/05/10/DI2005051001008.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">PBS: \u201cJames Dean: Sense Memories\u201d</a> By Keith Elliot Greenberg Applause. 304 pp. Paperback, $24.99 "}], "saliency": []}
{"docId": "52c06c0a32cd6dc1644cd53a4622f8b2", "title": "American Cool: An Interview with the curators", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "    I spoke with Joel Dinerstein and Frank H. Goodyear III, the curators of the new National Portrait Gallery exhibition \u201cAmerican Cool,\u201d about their show, the catalog and essays that accompany it, and how they came up with a workable definition of the cool. Here are edited excerpts of our conversation: <em>Why does the exhibition focus on celebrities? What about the \u201ccool\u201d among ordinary, everyday people?</em> Joel Dinerstein: The only way to actually examine [the concept of cool] is to look at public figures, people we all recognize. These are people who are discussed as cool, the obvious cases. There are many meanings of cool and not all of them are dealt with in this exhibit\u2026 It is not that there aren\u2019t [everyday] cool people in your life, but I don\u2019t know how we would address that in an art exhibit. <em>And why the focus on popular rather than high culture?</em> Frank H. Goodyear III: The goal of the exhibition was to excavate the origins of cool as an oppositional persona, to understand [how] cool originates as a slang term in jazz, first introduced in the late \u201930s and early  \u201940s, and popular among a group of African- American jazz musicians. It has wide resonance in the world of Hollywood, and it begins to evolve in different arenas of culture life in different ways. The great majority of the people in the show are popular musicians, popular actors. [While] there is a group of writers, [these are] writers who had a wide following, whose work resonated with the wider public. <em>What makes this concept particularly American?</em> JD: Ninety-nine out of 100 figures are working or middle class. [Other similar ideas such as] <i>sangfroid</i> are all about disenfranchised aristocracy, people who were entitled, by their wealth or social status. They didn\u2019t need to carve out space. They[had] it by virtue of their status. America is [all about a] willed self-invention. You create an identity different from your parents. [And we are] a nation of immigrants, people are not descended from any kind of social status. And\u2026 it is worth stating: This is a nation born in revolution, a country [that has] always valued rebellion. FHG: We discussed the notion of what does cool look like abroad. There are distinct traditions, many of them  are influenced by this American sense of cool. [But when people] are polled about who is the coolest country\u2014such polls have apparently been done\u2014invariably it is American musicians, American actresses and actors who take center stage. [The cool] is recognized [as] one of America\u2019s cultural contributions. <em>Why are you so confident that the cool is still relevant, that it can survive commercialization and corporate appropriation? Is the concept of cool dead?</em> JD: I am not as confident as you think I am. Which is to say I think it is a vital, worthy question. My answer is a cautious \u201cno\u201d for two reasons. One is that Americans still seem to care about the concept. I can tell by students\u2019 answers to essay questions that they still want it to be vital. People want to talk about it, who rates, and why. The larger question about commercialization? I am not sure cool will be transgressive as it was in the past, [as it] was when Hip hop first broke through. It is still an element, but it won\u2019t be the same element. Cool has always been and [is] more than ever a certain emergent strategy of individuality for a new generation. My two examples [today] would be someone like Jon Stewart, who carved out a new space. [If people say] there is an Egyptian Jon Stewart (and there is), and a Brazilian Jon Stewart (and there is), that means [he] has carved out a new terrain. The second example is \u2026 Benicio Del Torres, [with]  his synthesis of old-school film noir, African-American culture [and] a Nuevo Latino charismatic detachment. What really matters is that cool occupies the space [for] some new strategy for individuality. It is seen not [just] as celebrity, and not just wealth, but as artistic and rebellious self-expression. FHG: The term is not a static term, it is ever evolving. The period from the \u201980s to the present demonstrates the degree to which corporate America discovered the power of cool. That there were individuals who became wildly successful in this exhibition, fabulously wealthy, that was not for them being a sell-out as it might have been in a previous generation,  just another indication of achievement. <em>The exhibition relies almost exclusively on photographs. Why?</em> FHG: There is a distinct cool aesthetic [and] it is one that relies heavily on photography. It is interesting that with photography that we [believe] we can know someone through the photograph, but that perception is an illusion. We feel like we are looking into a peep hole\u2026but in fact these photographs really act as mirrors, we as the viewer see our own reflection. We [felt] that to be in the show we had to have a good picture [of the subject], a picture in which they project cool. There were figures like George Carlin [whom we considered], but when we went looking for pictures, there wasn\u2019t that cool public presentation that was captured in photography. As such Carlin was not in the show. <em>Is there a dark side to cool?</em> FHG: There are figures in the 20<sup>th</sup>century whom we regard today as saints, people like Martin Luther King, Cesar Chavez, Roberto Clemente, [but]  these individuals are not in this exhibition. There is a certain darkness, a certain edge, a mystery that pervades many of the individuals [we did include]. There are a number of very troubled individuals, even miscreants, who had difficult pasts and in some ways were using cool to navigate the challenges in their lives. JD: Negotiating the dark side is a necessary condition of cool. I think [the idea of the cool] crosses over [into mainstream culture] quickly because of the Great Depression and World War Two. When it first shows up in that period, there is this mask of cool as a stylish stoicism, which is about that generation facing up globally to a set  of challenges that are threatening. The reason that [Humphrey] Bogart ends up <i>the</i> cool figure is because he looks like he has navigated and negotiated some very dark periods in his life. The reason why \u201cCasablanca\u201d is still the number one or two films ever [as noted by the American Film Institute], and that is also true for an actress like Barbara Stanwyck.

King had died</a> the night before, the senior curator of photographs at the Smithsonian\u2019s <a href=\"http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/bb-king-s-portrait-view-national-portrait-gallery\">National Portrait Gallery</a> swung into action. \u201cI dropped everything, got on the computer and said, \u2018Can we get an in memoriam label up?'\u201d she recalls. Call it breaking-news museum curation. Messages were already pinging between curators, graphic designers and other museum staff: <em>Do we have a portrait of the late great bluesman? Can we acknowledge his passing?</em> Shumard of course knew that a fine black-and-white photographic portrait already was on display in a ground-floor exhibit dedicated to recent acquisitions. Shumard herself had helped the gallery acquire the gelatin silver print in 2013. It was made by <a href=\"http://www.chuckstewartphotographer.com/\">Chuck Stewart</a>, that great portraitist of the music world. He created the photo in 1992, a year after King opened his blues club on Beale Street in Memphis. [<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/defining-cool-from-walt-whitman-and-james-dean-to-steve-jobs-and-tony-hawk/2014/02/05/159e6f9e-8e84-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html\"><em>\u2018American Cool\u2019 at the National Portrait Gallery</em></a>] The staff edited and printed new text to go with the portrait. Verbs were changed to the past tense. The year of his passing was included. And a special separate label was added: \u201cIn Memoriam 1925-2015.\u201d By the time the doors opened at 11:30 a.m., all was in place. Museum visitors noticed and were impressed. \u201cThat\u2019s an art museum paying attention to the real world,\u201d said Matt Stanley of Chantilly. \u201cWe just found out about it three hours ago, and it\u2019s already been acknowledged,\u201d said Olivia Harcourt of West Palm Beach, Fla. \u201cI knew he was on the edge, I didn\u2019t know he was gone,\u201d said Linda O\u2019Hare of Santa Barbara, Calif. The gallery\u2019s staff members have done this before \u2014 they quickly noted the passing of Robin Williams last year. The curators keep informal tabs on the living subjects of portraits in the collection. When possible, they update museum text in real time. They have noticed that National Portrait Gallery-goers are close readers of the text. However, unlike newspaper editors who keep pre-written obituaries of famous people handy, the curators don\u2019t compose post-mortem labels in advance. Seeing the portrait of King prompted people to stop and reflect on the passing of a legend. It turns out that almost everyone is a B.B. King fan on some level. \u201cI\u2019ve always appreciated how, in my generation, the people he brought up and the people he mentored,\u201d said Stanley, 57. \u201cStevie Ray Vaughan and Joe Bonamassa have really benefited a lot from him. The fact that he lasted that long and was still playing is fantastic.\u201d \u201cWe saw B.B. King at Toad\u2019s Place in New Haven\u201d about 10 years ago, said Larry Gluck, who lives outside New Haven, Conn. \u201cIt was amazing. At that point he was pretty sick with diabetes, but he could play like he was a young guy. It\u2019s not a night you forget.\u201d \u201cHis hand and guitar were like one,\u201d said Toby Gluck, Larry\u2019s wife. \u201cHe still had that smile on his face,\u201d Larry Gluck said, nodding at the portrait. The portrait shows a guitar player in rapture \u2014 eyes closed, blissful expression, finger hitting a note half-way up the guitar neck. Shumard, the curator, remembers seeing Stewart\u2019s photograph in an exhibit and knowing it was perfect for the gallery, which did not yet have a portrait of King. \u201cI loved the fact that this was a photographer who really got music and got musicians,\u201d Shumard says. \u201cIt feels wonderfully intimate. B.B. King is completely unaware of the camera, and consequently, the viewers of the picture feel as though they\u2019re right there with him.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

It can be tempting to export money and equipment to solve the problem. But when bioengineer <a href=\"http://bioengineering.rice.edu/faculty/rebecca_richards-kortum.aspx\">Rebecca Richards-Kortum</a> visits hospitals in places such as Malawi and El Salvador, she sees the unintended consequence of that charitable impulse. \u201cIronically, if you walk down the hall or into the basement of a hospital, there\u2019s always a big room that is just for broken, donated equipment,\u201d she says. The equipment works just fine in the United States, but in places plagued by lack of air conditioning, power outages, and challenges like dust and dirt, what would be a high-tech lifesaver in the U.S. is just another hunk of junk. Given the amount of time, energy, space and money that can go into figuring out how to use the equipment and repairing it when it breaks, says Richards-Kortum, \u201cit can hurt more than it helps.\u201d Could there be a better way? Richards-Kortum thinks so \u2014 and her efforts to bring affordable, adaptable technology to the world\u2019s poorest places earned her a spot in <a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/fellows/970/\">this year\u2019s class of MacArthur fellows</a>. Richards-Kortum, who heads up <a href=\"http://www.rice360.rice.edu/undergraduate\">Rice University\u2019s Institute for Global Health</a>, uses the latest advances in nanotechnology, fabrication and molecular imaging to help invent equipment that\u2019s rugged enough to stand up to the most challenging clinical conditions and cheap enough to make sense for communities that usually lack access to health care. \u201cCheaper can certainly be as effective,\u201d says Richards-Kortum. \u201cIn some cases it can be better in the sense that it improves access.\u201d Take her high-resolution microscopic endoscope, which her team developed in conditions in countries that have high rates of cervical cancer but low access to things like labs that process pap smears or biopsies. Rather than collect tissue that is then analyzed in a laboratory, the portable endoscope lets technicians view cervical tissue, diagnosing cancer in real time and for less money. And by using new fluorescent dyes developed by Richards-Kortum and her team, doctors can spot oral cancers without spending as much money or time as they would using traditional diagnostics. Resource constraints don\u2019t intimidate Richards-Kortum \u2014 they inspire her. \u201cThey force you to make really tough decisions,\u201d she says. \u201cI think you often end up with a better product.\u201d She passes on that philosophy to students in Beyond Traditional Borders, a program she developed that teaches undergraduates how to translate classroom ideas into global health solutions. Students focus their efforts not on hypothetical situations, but on real-world problems, developing technologies that fill health needs. For example, a group of her students recently invented an inexpensive <a href=\"http://www.rice360.rice.edu/bcpap\">bubble CPAP machine</a> for newborns who can\u2019t breathe due to respiratory infections. Developed in conjunction with practitioners in Malawi, the technology decreased mortality rates in one neonatal ward by 46 percent. And patients in developing countries aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from the program. Students who participate in real-world projects in the program, she says, graduate at higher rates than STEM majors who don\u2019t \u2014 especially women and underrepresented minority students. \u201cIf your inventions don\u2019t ever leave the lab, you\u2019re not doing your job,\u201d she says. Similarly, she says, inventions that are designed in a vacuum are useless. Rather, she teaches her students to collaborate with end users, clinicians, and patients in the countries they seek to serve. That collaborative process can lead to even more inventive solutions, like a rapid prototyping facility Richards-Kortum helped develop at the University of Malawi. \u201cThey came up with a way to locally repair oxygen concentrators,\u201d she says, instead of relying on a pricier, more complex fix. Though Richards-Kortum focuses the majority of her work on finding inexpensive ways to bring healthcare to the developing world, her inventions work the other way, too. She\u2019s currently working to figure out ways to bring her cervical cancer detection system, which is currently being deployed on vans throughout rural Brazil, to under-served places in the United States, like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. All that penny-pinching has earned Richards-Kortum an honor with a massive $625,000 stipend to use as she pleases. (\u201cI was sure it was a telemarketer, but it turned out to not be a telemarketer,\u201d she jokes of receiving the call from the foundation a few weeks ago.) She isn\u2019t sure yet how she\u2019ll use the money, but she\u2019s committed to using it to improve health for babies and pregnant women in Malawi. \u201cAt the current rate of progress, it\u2019s going to be 150 years before a baby who\u2019s born in Africa has the same chance of survival as a baby in North America,\u201d says Richard-Kortum. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d <em>Erin Blakemore (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/heroinebook\">@heroinebook</a>) is a freelance journalist from Boulder, Colo.

More confusing still was the official announcement, which stated with conspicuous vagueness that the \"traffic girl,\" as they're typically called, was being honored for \"safeguarding the security of the headquarters of the revolution in an unexpected circumstance.\" What circumstance? What does \"safeguarding\" mean? An official state <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/09/mystery-surrounds-north-koreas-bizarre-decision-to-grant-top-military-honor-to-traffic-cop/\">video</a> showed the traffic cop, a young woman name Ri Kong Sim, convulsing with emotion as she received her award. The conspiracy theories flowed quickly, with a North Korean defector organization suggesting that she may have saved leader Kim Jong Un from an assassination attempt. According to some thinly sourced reports, North Korean agents may have staged car accidents in the past to kill their targets. It turns out, though, that the explanation may be considerably more modest. New Focus International, a North Korean news organization that sources from defectors and from volunteer citizens within the country, <a href=\"http://newfocusintl.com/exclusive-why-north-korea-handed-a-bravery-award-to-ri-kyong-sim/\">says that its sources in Pyongyang indicate</a> that Ri \"received the award for putting out a fire that broke out near a propaganda poster.\" The poster allegedly bore the name of leader Kim Jong Un. This explanation might sound absurd, but it's not implausible. I suggested this could be the case in my original post on Ri's mysterious award, noting that North Korea often grants high honors to people who simply save official portraits of its national rulers. Those omnipresent portraits, like the Eucharist at a Catholic mass, are considered quasi-holy symbols of everything that\u2019s supposed to matter in the North Korean state ideology. New Focus International's story also notes that North Korea is still technically in a \"Grade 1 War-Readiness State,\" owing to recent tensions with the United States. This state includes special, heightened rules requiring citizens to protect images and icons of the leaders. That's partly about propaganda and ideology \u2013 Kim is the embodiment the state, after all \u2013 but it also has the nice effect, probably comforting for Kim, of making it the personal duty of every North Korea citizen to care so much about their leader that they'll even self-sacrifice to protect a banner carrying his name. \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Real-North-Korea-Stalinist/dp/0199964297/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\">The Real North Korea</a>,\" a new book by the highly respected scholar Andrei Lankov, also discusses the degree to which official state ideology treats posters and banners of the Kim family as holy relics, the embodiment of the semi-divine leaders themselves. In this clip, Lankov discusses an unsettling incident in which a father was rewarded for allowing his 5-year-old daughter to drown so that he could save a poster of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il: Think about that for a moment. If North Korean officials are going to promote this man as a hero for saving a poster of the Kims while his daughter drowned, would it really be so surprising if they granted a top military honor to a traffic cop who saved a burning banner bearing Kim Jong Un's name? That's a significantly different story from the initial rumor that she had prevented Kim's assassination. As the North Korea scholar Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ska_kongshan/status/332538485233836033\">quipped on Twitter</a>, \"We know so little about North Korea that a military medal given to a traffic cop becomes rumor of a coup.\" "}], "saliency": [{"id": 44210.0, "text": "Lankov", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Andrei Lankov", "entityid": 4420368}, {"id": 44220.0, "text": "Kim Jong Il", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Kim Jong-il", "entityid": 154099}, {"id": 44230.0, "text": "Kim Jong Un", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Kim Jong-un", "entityid": 5962511}, {"id": 44240.0, "text": "Twitter", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Twitter", "entityid": 9988187}, {"id": 44250.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 44260.0, "text": "Pyongyang", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Pyongyang", "entityid": 47948}, {"id": 44270.0, "text": "North Korean", "wiki_title": "enwiki:North Korea", "entityid": 21255}, {"id": 44280.0, "text": "Ich'on", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Ichon County", "entityid": 7850641}, {"id": 44290.0, "text": "Kim Il Sung", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Kim Il-sung", "entityid": 71022}]}

The move effectively shatters the glass ceiling that prevented women here from being promoted to top church jobs and was made possible after reformers and traditionalists reached a compromise that would satisfy parishes opposed to female bishops. At their annual gathering at the University of York, 351 members of the General Synod, the church\u2019s ruling body, <a href=\"http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2014/07/church-of-england-to-have-women-bishops.aspx\" title=\"www.churchofengland.org\">voted in favor of the proposal</a> while 72 voted against it and 10 abstained. That it has taken this long for the church, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, to make the move may seem baffling to Anglicans in countries such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, where women already serve as bishops. It has been baffling for many here, too, with churchgoers and even the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/cameron-church-of-england-needs-to-get-with-the-program-on-women-bishops/2012/11/21/157a0942-340d-11e2-bfd5-e202b6d7b501_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">prime minister </a>accusing the Church of England of being out of step with the times. But the issue of women as bishops remains highly divisive in the global Anglican community. The majority of the world\u2019s 80 million Anglicans reside in Africa, where many vehemently oppose the idea. In concessions to opponents with theological objections, the package of measures passed Monday allows a parish unsatisfied with a female bishop to ask for a male alternative and take its complaints to an independent body. \u201cYou don\u2019t chuck out family or even make it difficult for them to be at home,\u201d Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in reference to the traditionalists during a lively, five-hour debate that preceded the vote. When Welby was confirmed to his post last year, he inherited a church still reeling from a crisis sparked in 2012 after a similar proposal to ordain women as bishops was rejected by six votes. At the time, an influential group of lawmakers called for the government to intervene and revoke the church\u2019s exemption from equality legislation. The church approved the ordination of female priests 22 years ago, but they were barred from becoming bishops because of opposition from male clergy. Today, women make up about one-third of all church clergy but are <a href=\"http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1868964/ministry%20statistics%20final.pdf\" title=\"www.churchofengland.org\">less likely</a> than their male counterparts to receive a stipend for their work. During the gathering Monday, a message was read out from Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop of South Africa, where women already serve as bishops. \u201cWow, you are in for a great surprise and a treat,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYippee!\u201d "}], "saliency": [{"id": 44510.0, "text": "Welby", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Justin Welby", "entityid": 15703656}, {"id": 44520.0, "text": "University of York", "wiki_title": "enwiki:University of York", "entityid": 155637}, {"id": 44530.0, "text": "Anglican Communion", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Anglican Communion", "entityid": 909}, {"id": 44540.0, "text": "Church of England", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Church of England", "entityid": 5955}, {"id": 44550.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 44560.0, "text": "New Zealand", "wiki_title": "enwiki:New Zealand", "entityid": 812333}, {"id": 44570.0, "text": "General Synod", "wiki_title": "enwiki:General Synod", "entityid": 12985}, {"id": 44580.0, "text": "Desmond Tutu", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Desmond Tutu", "entityid": 8401973}, {"id": 44590.0, "text": "Africa", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Africa", "entityid": 304}, {"id": 44510.0, "text": "Canada", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Canada", "entityid": 2274514}, {"id": 44511.0, "text": "South Africa", "wiki_title": "enwiki:South Africa", "entityid": 2397252}]}

They were there for a 12-day Hindu religious bathing ceremony called Godavari Maha Pushkaram, convinced a dip in the water would wash away their sins. In the surge of humanity, some pilgrims lost their shoes and, when they fought the crowd to retrieve them, they triggered a deadly stampede \u2014 the kind that has devastated the country throughout the years. Witness said <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/60eb21e94a714ad29429ce5813d4441e/stampede-kills-9-during-religious-festival-india\">some tried to scale a wall</a> near the river.

Such stampedes, particularly at places of pilgrimage, have plagued India for years, so much so that despite the vast number of lives they claim, they receive little notice outside the country. As the thousands of faithful stream in through narrow passages to the water, they often find themselves on slippery and uneven slopes and crumbling stairways, called \u201cghats,\u201d which can become treacherous when panic ensues. Since many are in rural areas, anything amounting to crowd control is sparse or nonexistent. Those who have witnessed these tragedies come away horrified. Still, the incidents are no deterrent to those whose religious fervor and traditions beckon. More than 1,000 people have been killed in stampedes during the past decade, the worst of which came in 2005 when nearly 350 people were killed and more than 200 were injured at a religious festival at Mandher Devi temple in western Maharashtra, according to <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/godavari-pushkaram-major-stampedes-in-india-in-last-10-years/1/451299.html\">India Today</a>.

Here\u2019s a look at what the report\u2019s data show: In the year 2000, 10.9 percent of West Virginian households received food stamps\u2014more than any other state. Today, 37 states boast rates above that level. Four states\u2014Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan and Massachusetts\u2014saw SNAP reliance more than triple by 2013. Another 26 saw rates more than double. Michigan and Oregon posted the largest percentage point increases, with rates up 11.7  points in each. Wyoming has seen food stamp use rise the least, with a mere 0.5 percentage point rise, the only one lacking statistical significance. The rate in Washington, D.C. rose from 8.8 percent in 2000 to 15.7 percent, a 6.9 point rise. Today, the share of households on food stamps is as high as 19.8 percent in Oregon and 19.4 percent in Mississippi and as little as 5.9 percent in Wyoming. Southern states are home to some of the highest rates of food stamp reliance, as the Census Bureau notes. States in the Midwest and West have some of the lowest rates. Nearly half the states in 2000 had SNAP rates below today\u2019s minimum 5.9 percent, with Colorado boasting the lowest rate of 3.3 percent back then. Another 14 states had rates below 5 percent. Just three states\u2014West Virginia, Kentucky and Louisiana\u2014had rates above 10 percent in 2000.

{"docId": "defd7f4a85496d52a210938d58a7ae76", "title": "Do the benefits of a college education outweigh the cost?", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "It\u2019s late August and thousands of teenagers are moving out of home to begin their college careers. While these freshmen are undoubtedly excited about starting this new adventure, as time passes, many of them might wonder whether the benefits of their college education will be worth the cost to obtain that education. Their parents who are footing a bill that may exceed a quarter of a million dollars by the time their child earns the prized college degree may also wonder whether those funds could have been better invested elsewhere. This kind of thinking may be particularly true for students who will borrow tens of thousands of dollars to pay for their bachelor\u2019s degree and yet may find themselves four years later working at a Starbucks or driving a car for Uber. It\u2019s also this kind of thinking that\u2019s reflected in <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/05/15/is-college-worth-it/\">surveys</a> like the one the Pew Research Center conducted a few years ago that reported a majority of Americans said that college wasn\u2019t \u201cworth it\u201d because it didn\u2019t \u201cprovide students with good value for the money they and their families spend,\u201d and in the recent household <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201407.pdf\">survey</a> by the Federal Reserve Board, where 37 percent of respondents said that the net financial benefit of their education was negative. Those are pretty sobering figures for a country where two out of three recent high school graduates are enrolled in college, up from just one in two graduates 30 years ago. Why are they going to college if it\u2019s not worth it? This is a difficult question to ask, especially considering that President Obama has <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/\">said</a> that \u201cHigher education is not a luxury. Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs, and one that everyone should be able to afford.\u201d So, the question becomes, would students be more satisfied with their college education if it didn\u2019t cost so much? Before answering that question, it\u2019s worth looking in depth at how much it costs to attend college. That\u2019s a hard question to answer because there are wide differences between the sticker price of a year in college \u2014 it averages about $40,000 a year at a four-year, private institution and $17,000 at a four-year public institution \u2014 and what a student actually pays out of pocket after taking into account financial aid, scholarships, and other tuition assistance programs. (The comparable figures covering just tuition and fees are about $29,000 at a private college and $8,000 at a public college, according to the <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp\">National Center for Education Statistics</a>.) Thus, answering the question about whether college is worth it from a financial point of view depends on knowing how much financial \u201chelp\u201d a student receives from the college. By way of comparison, consider two private and two public four-year, degree granting universities. The first is George Washington University, where I teach economics, and the second is the University of California at Berkeley, where I earned my undergraduate degree. I\u2019ve added Harvard University because that school is often used as a standard for many comparisons, and California State University at Los Angeles because it\u2019s a low-cost public institution. The data come from the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"http://collegecost.ed.gov/scorecard/index.aspx\">College Affordability and Transparency Center</a>, which shows the average net price a student pays per year at the particular college or university. The net price subtracts grants and scholarships, which are amounts that a student doesn\u2019t have to pay back, from the total cost of attendance to obtain a figure that reflects a student\u2019s actual costs. (The total cost includes room and board, books and supplies, and personal expenses.) The student will have to pay back any loans taken out to pay for the remaining expenses. According to the CATC, a typical <a href=\"http://collegecost.ed.gov/scorecard/UniversityProfile.aspx?org=s&id=131469\">GWU </a>student will pay a net price of $31,443 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will borrow a total of $24,050 and make $276.77 payments each month for 10 years to repay the loan. A typical student at<a href=\"http://collegecost.ed.gov/scorecard/UniversityProfile.aspx?org=s&id=110635\"> U.C.-Berkeley</a> will pay $16,178 a year after scholarships and grants and have $16,028 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $184.45 over 10 years. For <a href=\"http://collegecost.ed.gov/scorecard/UniversityProfile.aspx?org=s&id=166027\">Harvard</a>, a student will pay $14,445 a year after scholarships and grants and take out $11,000 in federal loans for a monthly payment of $126.59 over 10 years. Finally, a student at <a href=\"http://collegecost.ed.gov/scorecard/UniversityProfile.aspx?org=s&id=110592\">California State University-Los Angeles</a> will pay $3,713 a year after scholarships and grants. That student will have the same amount of federal student loans as the Harvard student and, therefore, have the same monthly $126.59 payment. Four colleges, four net prices: $31,443, $16,178, $14,445, and $3,713. Which college provides the greatest net benefit? It\u2019s hard to tell. But, what these figures do show is that looking at the sticker price doesn\u2019t reflect the value of a college education. Moreover, even the net price doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, since scholarships and grants aren\u2019t the only things that reduce the cost of college. Students (or their parents) may also qualify for a host of education-based <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Benefits-for-Education:-Information-Center\">tax breaks</a>, such as the American Opportunity and the Lifetime Learning Credit, and may set aside money in tax-favored education savings accounts, known as Section 529 plans and Coverdell Education Saving Accounts, that reduce the cost of saving for college. In many cases, interest paid on qualified student loans is tax deductible. Finally, the federal government offers several \u201cincome-driven\u201d student <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/06/07/income-based-repayment-everything-you-need-know\">loan repayment</a> plans that limit the monthly payments to a certain amount of income in exchange for extending the loan repayment period and forgive any loan amount unpaid after that period. One plan recently cut the monthly payments from 15 percent to 10 percent of disposable income and reduced the repayment period to 20 years from 25 years. Most federal student loans qualify for one of these loan repayment plans. Despite these figures, some argue that these loan repayment programs represent \u201cgovernment bailouts\u201d of college graduates, as Lindsey Burke <a href=\"http://dailysignal.com/2014/06/09/governments-bailout-college-grads-continues/\">wrote</a> in \u201cThe Signal.\u201d Others note that a college degree is no longer required to get a good job, especially since almost four of every ten college graduates are working at jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree. Fruzsina Eordogh is one of those <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/27/us-attn-andrea-education-dropouts-idUSBRE82Q0Y120120327\">students</a> who dropped out of college to work as a full-time writer for the Daily Dot (Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, and Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs are three of America\u2019s most famous college dropouts.) But, just because the job doesn\u2019t require a college degree doesn\u2019t mean that a college degree isn\u2019t a good investment. People with college degrees tend to keep their jobs during recessions and have a lower unemployment rate over time than those with just a high school degree. Most of the new post-recession jobs <a href=\"http://blogs.kqed.org/lowdown/2014/01/14/is-college-really-worth-it/\">require</a> a college degree. As the Pew Research Center found, the \u201cbig payoff\u201d to a college degree isn\u2019t so much in earnings but the ability to have and to keep a job. Finally, it\u2019s important to look beyond financial compensation to measure the benefits of a college education. Studies show that people with more education are in better health, their children are in better health, and their marriages are more stable relative to people with less education. The point of these studies isn\u2019t whether college provides a net financial benefit to the student, but whether college provides a net benefit overall. Here, the bottom line is positive. The Pew survey showed that the vast majority of graduates from a four-year institution say their college education helped them grow intellectually and to mature as a person. In other words, college may teach students as much about getting along with people as it does about analyzing Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets. On that score, college provides a clear net benefit, not just for the student but for society as well.

Working with a government health agency, they used mobile roadside film shows to educate the community about the risks of polio and show testimonies from caretakers of polio sufferers and those affected by the disease. And they directly involved local Muslim leaders called imams, who had been distrustful of the vaccination programs, to mobilize the communities. \u201cThis is the society I belong to, and I know how seriously they take the message from the Friday prayers. I believe they will take the advice of the imam most seriously,\u201d said Aliyu, lead author of the report published Tuesday in <a href=\"http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001687\" title=\"www.plosmedicine.org\">PLOS Medicine.</a> In six months of the pilot program, the number of immunized children younger than 5 went from 2,755 to 11,364. Aliyu said that when he was growing up in Jigawa state in northern Nigeria, he saw many children affected by polio, a crippling and potentially fatal disease. He believed, like many, that it was caused by a bad spirit. \u201cThe local community believed the disease was spread by a demon spirit and if you were unlucky you might come across it and it would strike you, and your limb would be paralyzed,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know this is something infectious, something you can get from the environment.\u201d At medical school in Zaria, another northern state, he learned about polio and realized the bad curse was in fact a disease that could be protected against. In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries, according to UNICEF. Since then, through aggressive vaccination programs, the virus has been almost eradicated in most countries, with the notable exceptions of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. Until two or three years ago, Nigeria, and particularly Kano in the predominantly Muslim north of Africa\u2019s most populous country, was the epicenter of global polio infections, according to UNICEF. Opposition to the vaccine by some local scientists and rumors that the vaccines caused sterility and were a covert attempt to reduce the Muslim population in the north added to resistance. Incidents such as when a small number of vaccine-induced infections in 2006 led to outbreaks bolstered these fears. A milestone for the program was when it gained the support of the Sultan of Sokoto, a spiritual leader in Nigeria, who helped launch the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee for Primary Health Care and Polio Eradication in 2009. In 2010, a team of experts consisting mainly of Ni\u00adger\u00adian Muslim scientists was formed to assist the committee, which included four of the authors of the new report. The team mapped the high-risk areas in the north within the 12 polio-prevalent states and set up the Northern Religious Leaders Contact Group, assisted by the sharia boards and ministries for religious affairs. The program has since provided training for about 18,000 Muslim imams, through 10 weekly sessions, educating them on the facts about polio, providing a platform for discussion, answering questions and concerns, and arming them with advice they can share with their communities. Imams were given template sermons about polio and the importance of vaccination that they could use during Friday prayers and daily discussions. \u201cThe missing link with campaigns in the past was that we didn\u2019t figure out how to connect with the society,\u201d Aliyu said. \u201cFrom now on, we will maximize the use of traditional and religious leaders as part of the campaign.\u201d When the committee of imams was launched in 2009, there were 384 new wild poliovirus cases reported in Nigeria, most in the northern states. By 2010, the number of reported cases had plummeted to 21. In 2011, however, there were 62 cases in the northern states, and 118 in 2012. Last year the number of cases dropped to 49. According to UNICEF, there have been five cases so far in 2014, three of which were in Kano state. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing exciting news in Nigeria,\u201d said Sarah Crowe, chief of crisis communications at UNICEF. \u201cIt\u2019s the next big hope.\u201d Read: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-virus-sleuths-and-public-health-officials-track-the-cause-of-a-mysterious-illness/2014/03/07/d6df0dcc-a3b9-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Virus sleuths, public health officials track mysterious polio-like virus</a> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 80110.0, "text": "UNICEF", "wiki_title": "enwiki:UNICEF", "entityid": 299921}, {"id": 80120.0, "text": "Canada", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Canada", "entityid": 2274514}, {"id": 80130.0, "text": "Jigawa", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Jigawa State", "entityid": 2227632}, {"id": 80140.0, "text": "University of Manitoba", "wiki_title": "enwiki:University of Manitoba", "entityid": 32099}, {"id": 80150.0, "text": "Zaria", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Zaria", "entityid": 2768647}, {"id": 80160.0, "text": "Gezawa", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Gezawa", "entityid": 24869855}, {"id": 80170.0, "text": "Nigerian", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Nigeria", "entityid": 21383}, {"id": 80180.0, "text": "Kano", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Kano State ", "entityid": 21383}, {"id": 80190.0, "text": "Sokoto", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Sokoto", "entityid": 537175}]}
{"docId": "82609e74-fd77-11e3-b1f4-8e77c632c07b", "title": "Promising new approach helps curb early schizophrenia in teens, young adults", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "The first time Jeremy Clark met his 18-year-old client, the teenager was sitting in his vice principal\u2019s office, the drawstrings of his black hoodie pulled tight. Jacob had recently disclosed to his friends on Facebook that he was hearing voices, and their reaction had been less than sympathetic. So Clark was relieved when a beaming Jacob showed up on time for their next meeting, at a comic book shop. As the pair bantered about \u201cStar Wars\u201d and a recent Captain America movie, however, Clark picked up troubling signs: Jacob said he was \u201cdetaching\u201d from his family, often huddling alone in his room. As the visit ended, Clark gave the teen a bear hug and made a plan. \u201cLet\u2019s get together again next week,\u201d he said. The visit was part of a new approach being used nationwide to find and treat teenagers and young adults with early signs of schizophrenia. The goal is to bombard them with help even before they have had a psychotic episode \u2014 a dramatic and often devastating break with reality that is a telltale sign of the disease. The program involves an intensive two-year course of socialization, family therapy, job and school assistance, and, in some cases, antipsychotic medication. What makes the treatment unique is that it focuses deeply on family relationships, and occurs early in the disease, often before a diagnosis. So far, the results have been striking: In Portland, Maine, where the treatment was pioneered, the rate of hospitalizations for first psychotic episodes fell by 34 percent over a six-year period, according to a March study. And just last month, <a href=\"http://m.schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/07/25/schbul.sbu108\" title=\"m.schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org\">a peer-reviewed study published</a> in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin found that young people undergoing the treatment at six sites around the country were more likely to be in school or working than adolescents who were not in the program. The research was funded by a <a href=\"http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/program_results_reports/2013/rwjf408484\" title=\"www.rwjf.org\">$17 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>. Proponents do not claim to be preventing schizophrenia. But they say the treatment helps patients remain functioning members of society and avoid chronic disability. These supporters are pressing for a broader use of the approach \u2014 and are making progress with state officials. The urgency to find and treat people with serious mental illness has intensified in the aftermath of several mass shootings, some of which were committed by people with severe psychiatric problems. But some mental health experts, including those at the federal National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), say more research is needed before the treatment is implemented widely. They warn that there is a risk of exposing to antipsychotic drugs some young people who were never going to develop schizophrenia. Studies have shown that a majority of young people who experience early symptoms, including hearing voices or seeing shadows, never develop schizophrenia or related diseases. Schizophrenia, which is associated with erratic behavior and delusions, affects 2.4 million Americans. Early intervention is critical, not only because the disease becomes harder to treat with each psychotic episode, but also because a break can be traumatic, with young people ending up in jail or strapped to a gurney in a psychiatric ward. The onset of the disease often occurs in adolescence, sending promising athletes and straight-A students on a downward spiral that can lead to homelessness or prison, or life in an institution. \u201cEven now, looking back, I could imagine going the same way you see people on the street,\u201d said Kevin, 21, who takes part in an early-intervention program in Bend, Ore. He asked that his last name be withheld so as not to hurt his job prospects. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of really scary to be able to relate to that group.\u201d Kevin had been an avid athlete and a good student during his senior year of high school, when he felt \u201ca bunch of splits inside me,\u201d a sensation he later learned was an early sign of schizophrenia. He began hearing whispers and seeing imaginary bugs skitter across his room. Doctors and antidepressants didn\u2019t help. Finally, a family friend recommended the program. It was a lifesaver, he said. A year later, his symptoms worsened. The voices became louder. He started staying up all night, writing song lyrics on scraps of paper that he would paste all over his walls. The early-intervention counselor recognized that he was having a psychotic break, got him medication and taught him to recognize the signs of things going awry, such as going to bed after 9 p.m. or not playing the guitar. A large percentage of people with schizophrenia end up on disability. One of the most expensive diseases, schizophrenia costs society about <a href=\"http://article.psychiatrist.com/dao_1-login.asp?ID=10001442&RSID=85291608335670\" title=\"article.psychiatrist.com\">$63 billion a year</a>, including expenses related to homelessness, law enforcement and unemployment benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling what the implications of this [new approach] might be for health and the economy,\u201d said William R. McFarlane, the psychiatrist and professor at the Maine Medical Center who developed the treatment. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about the onset of psychosis, which is what a lot of people focus on,\u201d he added. \u201cThe real question is: Can you get these kids to function in a normal way in spite of having a risk for psychosis or even having a brief episode? What [our program] says is, \u2018Yes, you can, if you have the right treatment.\u2019 \u201d But concerns among federal health officials prompted Congress<b> </b>earlier this year to reject a request from some mental health professionals and state health departments to allow states to use their mental health grants for the pre-psychotic treatment program. \u201cNot all the questions are known,\u201d said Robert K. Heinssen, director of the division of services and intervention research at the NIMH and study director for a <a href=\"http://www.raiseetp.org/\" title=\"www.raiseetp.org\">separate project called RA1SE</a> that looks at similar interventions for people who have had a psychotic break. He said there is much more evidence of the treatment\u2019s effectiveness for people who have had a such an episode. \u201cThe studies that have been done have not demonstrated that the approach is really effective in preventing psychosis, and at the same time there is a growing literature that is telling us that even minimum exposure to antipsychotic medications can have profound side effects in young people, including developing hypertension and weight gain,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not a benign intervention.\u201d Advocates of the treatment say their screening process is rigorous and weeds out most people who are unlikely to develop psychosis. They add that many patients are never prescribed medication for the illness. Their results have been compelling enough that similar programs are being conducted in Michigan, New Mexico and New York and in five counties in California. Programs are being set up in Delaware and Pennsylvania as well. McFarlane stops short of saying the treatment prevents schizophrenia, because the disease\u2019s genetic component cannot be treated. But he said that stress plays a role, and that the program works by helping young people manage that stress. That is how Tiffany Martinez says the program worked for her. While a freshman in college in southern Maine, she began seeing shadows and figures out of the corner of her eye. She began believing that trees would fall on her and took the long way to class to avoid them. Then she found McFarlane\u2019s program. With the program\u2019s help, she was able to graduate from college, even joining a sorority while she was there, and complete her master\u2019s degree in nursing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have schizophrenia,\u201d said Martinez, 26. \u201cIt was a process that was starting to be underway. Because I was 17 and my brain was still developing, because of the right medication \u2014 the right treatment, including the counseling \u2014 I think my brain has been able to recover in such a way that it stopped the progression of an illness.\u201d The Eugene program is based at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center, a local hospital, and provides treatment to about 30 young people from the area, including about half a dozen who have not had a psychotic break. The program is funded in part by Medicaid, private insurance and a $475,000 grant from the state. The patients, who are in the program voluntarily, have been referred by a variety of people \u2014 parents, counselors, teachers, friends. They undergo a rigorous screening process that includes a battery of questions: Are you ever confused about what is real or imaginary? Does time ever seem unnaturally fast or slow? The answers can be startling. One teen claimed on the test that he could smell a friend who lived in a different town. The therapy touches every part of their lives. Counselors may tell teachers that their clients need more time between classes to avoid crowds, or advise employers that allowing patients to wear headphones on the job will help them drown out imaginary voices. A large part of the treatment focuses on the family; the Eugene program even helped one mother get a job. Jacque Travis, a Eugene therapist who works with adolescents, has embraced the program because it gives her ways to help young people. Before, there was little she could do for teens who showed up at her practice with symptoms except wait until they had psychotic breaks and involuntarily commit them. Pre-psychotic teens are easy to spot, Travis said. They might have sleep problems or feel that their minds are playing tricks on them. They may have an odd stance or tilt to their heads. \u201cI can tell they are listening to something else or attuned to something else,\u201d she said. Jeremy Clark, the counselor, said being a friend to these young people is crucial. \u201cSo many of these kids are isolating or distancing themselves from their families,\u201d he said. Clark often takes his young clients to Nostalgia Comics, a well-stocked comic book store with vintage \u201cArchie\u201d titles alongside current issues of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d His clients seem to respond to comic books, he said, with their themes of being different and overcoming hardships. After the visit with Jacob, Clark wound his car out of the city center into a more hardscrabble area of Northwest Eugene. He pulled up in front of a small house, the parched lawn strewn with bikes. Aaron Divita, 16, bounded out the door, his right arm marked with an angular tattoo and his face stretched into a grin. When they first met, Clark, with his goatee and dad jeans, was not sure how he would get along with the fashion-forward teen, who has struggled with depression and has a family history of schizophrenia. But the two had clicked, and on that sizzling day decided to cool off at Skip\u2019s Records, where they swapped trivia about musicians ranging from Alice Cooper to Biz Markie. Amid the chitchat, Clark checked in: How is it going with the voices? \u201cI\u2019ve been tuning it out a bit, with music,\u201d Aaron said. Have you been exercising? \u201cCrunches almost every day,\u201d Aaron said. Clark bought Aaron a CD \u2014 a recent album by Tyler, the Creator, a quirky and controversial rap artist. The sun had dimmed by the time Clark took him home. \u201cThanks for getting me out of the house,\u201d Aaron called out before racing into his front door.

{"docId": "6668d83480f5c58b54a90770835ac2d4", "title": "Saudi Arabia bought a huge stake in Uber. What does that mean for female drivers?", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "This week the Silicon Valley-based ride-sharing app Uber announced it was getting a huge new injection of funding. But the money wasn't coming from any of the standard investors from the U.S. tech world. Instead, it was coming from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi state's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was putting $3.5 billion into the company, the largest investment in Uber to date. The move has raised eyebrows, however, due to one of the kingdom's most notorious domestic policies: Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women cannot legally drive. While the act of driving for women is not specifically banned, various religious edicts in the country have meant women are restricted from applying for a driving license, effectively making the act of driving illegal for Saudi women. While some women in rural areas do drive without licenses anyway and some women with foreign driving licenses occasionally get behind the wheel (a legal gray area used largely in protest), for the most part women in Saudi Arabia simply don't drive. Polls suggest that support for the policy <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/11/a-social-media-campaign-to-get-saudi-women-driving-finds-support-but-also-mockery/\">within the country is mixed</a>. Uber, of course, does not deliberately restrict female drivers. At <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/driver-partner-survey/\">the end of 2015</a>, the company said that only 19 percent of the drivers using the app were women but that it was actively trying to increase that percentage. The Saudi government will now be given a direct say in Uber's decision making process \u2014 PIF was given a seat on the board as part of the deal \u2014 but a representative of Uber said that the investment would definitely not limit women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women are allowed to drive. What's more complicated, however, is the role that Uber already plays in Saudi Arabia's gender politics. While the country's drivers are almost certainly entirely male, Uber's own figures show their Saudi passengers are more than 80 percent female. For many women in the country, the app and its competitors offer a chance at greater autonomy. Public transportation in Saudi Arabia is largely poor, and it can be difficult to find a regular taxi at times. Many families can't afford to hire a driver to take women places on their own. The end result is that if you are a Saudi woman and you want to commute to work or run errands on your own, a ride-sharing app can become an important tool. \u201cThere are some [women] that take five to 10 trips with us every day,\u201d Mudassir Sheikha, the founder of local Uber rival Careem <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-saudi-women-rideshare-apps-20150507-story.html\">told the Los Angeles Times last year</a>. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that kind of traffic anywhere.\u201d Uber has acknowledged the role its app plays in the country, usually portraying it as a strength. In December the company offered free Uber rides to Saudi women during the first election in which they were legally allowed to vote. \u201cOf course we think women should be allowed to drive,\u201d Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman, told <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/technology/uber-investment-saudi-arabia.html\">the New York Times this week</a>. \u201cIn the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn\u2019t exist before \u2014 and we\u2019re incredibly proud of that.\u201d It's expected now that the Saudi investment in Uber should end lingering questions about the legality of the service in the country. Yet the company could also be accused of providing a reprieve for the Saudi government from dealing with the issues surrounding female drivers in the country. Members of the Saudi royal family have repeatedly suggested that they believe women should be able to drive \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a powerful voice in the country, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-04-21/the-2-trillion-project-to-get-saudi-arabia-s-economy-off-oil\">recently suggested</a> that \"women don\u2019t get their complete rights granted them by Islam.\u201d Yet no real moves toward lifting the restrictions on female drivers have been seen recently. Crown Prince Mohammed <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-26/prince-says-saudi-arabia-not-yet-ready-to-allow-women-to-drive\">said in April</a> that the country was still \"not convinced about women driving.\" The problem is likely opposition from the Saudi kingdom's powerful religious community, which largely opposes female drivers. While one cleric <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/29/world/meast/saudi-arabia-women-driving-cleric/\">infamously suggested</a> that driving could damage women's ovaries, many focus on more practical reasons: What happens if a female driver is pulled over by a male cop? Saudi Arabia's religious customs would find this type of interaction between male and female strangers inappropriate (the interaction between Saudi women and male Uber drivers raises fewer eyebrows because it is transactional in nature). Saudi Arabia has announced its intentions to hire more female police officers, but progress remains slow. Meanwhile, public transport projects are also making slim progress. Riyadh's planned metro station is not slated to open until 2018. And while Uber is an option for some women, for many it's still too expensive for any kind of regular use. Some observers wonder if the eventual end of Saudi Arabia's restrictions on female drivers will come from self-driving cars rather than anything else. The Saudi government gets more complicated still when you consider the broader economic factors at play. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed has become the figurehead of a widely publicized push (dubbed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/25/saudi-arabia-announces-plan-to-end-its-addiction-to-oil/\">Saudi Vision 2030</a>) to modernize the Saudi economy and end its \"addiction\" to oil. The hope is to diversify the country's business world, using the country's vast wealth it has accumulated over the years to invest in profitable ventures and focusing on underdeveloped industries like tourism and arms. There's a social component at work here, too, most notably in the significant cuts being made to the subsidies given to Saudi citizens. Female citizens are being encouraged to enter the workforce, with Mohammed stating the aim was to increase their participation from 22 percent to 30 percent by 2030. Such moves may soon put the ruling Saudi royals at odds with the country's religious elite, potentially shattering a partnership that has provided relative stability to the country for decades. The investment in Uber seems to be a sign that the Saudi state is willing to bet big on the country's economic future. How those economic bets will translate socially is hard to predict. <strong>More on WorldViews</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/25/saudi-arabia-announces-plan-to-end-its-addiction-to-oil/\">Saudi Arabia announces plan to end its \u2018addiction\u2019 to oil</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/09/the-facts-and-a-few-myths-about-saudi-arabia-and-human-rights/\">The facts \u2014 and a few myths \u2014 about Saudi Arabia and human rights</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/12/17/saudi-arabias-islamic-military-alliance-against-terrorism-makes-no-sense/\">Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u2018Islamic military alliance\u2019 against terrorism makes no sense</a> <em>Update: This post has been amended to include comment from an Uber representative who said the Saudi investment would not restrict women drivers on the app in the United States or other countries where women can legally drive.</em> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 80210.0, "text": "Riyadh", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Riyadh", "entityid": 51554}, {"id": 80220.0, "text": "Saudi", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Saudi Arabia", "entityid": 349303}, {"id": 80230.0, "text": "Careem", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Careem", "entityid": 50061672}, {"id": 80240.0, "text": "Jill Hazelbaker", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Jill Hazelbaker", "entityid": 8553335}, {"id": 80250.0, "text": "PIF", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia", "entityid": 50260151}, {"id": 80260.0, "text": "New York Times", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Category:The New York Times", "entityid": 1336671}, {"id": 80270.0, "text": "Los Angeles Times", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Los Angeles Times", "entityid": 273319}, {"id": 80280.0, "text": "U.S.", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 80290.0, "text": "Silicon Valley", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Silicon Valley", "entityid": 26976}, {"id": 80210.0, "text": "Mohammed", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mohammad bin Salman", "entityid": 38689358}, {"id": 80211.0, "text": "Uber", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Uber (company)", "entityid": 56426591}]}
{"docId": "cad56e871cd0bca6cc77e97ffe246258", "title": "The middle class is shrinking just about everywhere in America", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2014/12/12/why-americas-middle-class-is-lost/\">great shrinking of the middle class</a> that has captured the attention of the nation is not only playing out in troubled regions like the Rust Belt, Appalachia and the Deep South, but in just about every metropolitan area in America, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/11/americas-shrinking-middle-class-a-close-look-at-changes-within-metropolitan-areas\">major new analysis</a> by the Pew Research Center. Pew reported in December that a clear majority of American adults <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/09/the-american-middle-class-is-losing-ground/\">no longer live in the middle class</a>, a demographic reality shaped by decades of widening inequality, declining industry and the erosion of financial stability and family-wage jobs. But while much of the attention has focused on communities hardest hit by economic declines, the new Pew data, based on metro-level income data since 2000, show that middle-class stagnation is a far broader phenomenon. The share of adults living in middle-income households has also dwindled in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta and Denver. It's fallen in smaller Midwestern metros where the middle class has long made up an overwhelming majority of the population. It's withering in coastal tech hubs, in military towns, in college communities, in Sun Belt cities. The decline of the American middle class is \"a pervasive local phenomenon,\" according to Pew, which analyzed census and American Community Survey data in 229 metros across the country, encompassing about three-quarters of the U.S. population. In 203 of those metros, the share of adults in middle-income households fell from 2000 to 2014. Pew defines middle-income households here as those making between two-thirds and twice the national median household income. For a three-person household in 2014, that means an income between about $42,000 and $125,000.  The fact that median incomes have declined over this same time frame also means that the bar to get into the middle class is actually lower now than it was in 2000. Pew's metro-level data are also adjusted for household size and local cost of living. The shrinking middle class is in part a reflection of rising income inequality in America, and of the same underlying and uneven economic forces that have fueled the rise of Donald Trump. And as the middle class has been shrinking, median incomes have fallen, too. In 190 of these 229 metros, the median income dropped over this same time. As the middle class has shrunk, Pew points out, the lower and upper classes in America have grown in size and significance. In some metros, the middle class is dwindling primarily because families are falling out of it and into the lower class. The share of households in this bottom tier has skyrocketed since 2000, for instance, in Goldbsoro, North Carolina, a railroad junction with an Air Force base. But in other places, the shrinking middle class is actually a sign of economic gains, as more people who were once middle class have joined the ranks at the top. This has been the case in booming energy hubs like Midland, Texas. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the share of adults living in lower-income households has actually held steady over this time. The households disappearing from the middle-class, rather, are reflected in the growing numbers at the top (this does not mean, though, that the same middle-class families are necessarily becoming wealthier; changes in the population makeup of the region may also reflect who moves away from the area and who migrates in). In total, 172 of these 229 metros saw a growing share of households in the upper-income tier. About as many \u2014 160 \u2014 saw a growing share at the bottom. And 108 experienced both: The middle class shrank as the ranks of both the poor and the rich grew. The places with greatest net economic losses \u2014 where the shrinking middle-class has meant a sizable influx of households among the poor \u2014 are metro areas that have historically relied heavily on manufacturing, like Detroit, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Springfield, Ohio. In only about a quarter of all of these metros does the middle class make up less than a majority of the adult population today. But the largest metros in the country fall into this group, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. In each of these metros, the middle class is relatively small because the upper-class share of the population is larger than average. These same metros also tend to have wider income inequality, reflecting the broad spectrum of jobs in industries from the low-paying service sector to finance and biotech. As a result, not surprisingly, Pew's data shows that metros with greater income inequality tend to have smaller middle classes. When the income distribution is narrower, on the other hand, more people are likely to be clustered in that middle tier between $42,000 and $125,000.

The area surrounding the capitol building has long been controversial because it houses a statue of Roger Taney, the Supreme Court justice who authored the proslavery Dred Scott decision. A compromise struck in the mid-1990s kept the Taney statue on the grounds while adding a statue of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the nation\u2019s highest court. Legislation that called for placing statues of Tubman and fellow abolitionist Frederick Douglass alongside Taney failed in 2012 and 2013.

Initial <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/04/AR2005110401800.html\">predictions were dire</a>, but during recent years it\u2019s become clear that the snakehead is <a href=\"https://blog.wildlife.virginia.gov/2017/05/snakes-in-the-grass/\">just another fish</a> in the river. The snakehead has not destroyed the Potomac River\u2019s ecosystem as first predicted, and it appears that it\u2019s coexisting with the other game fish in the river just fine. According to <a href=\"http://www.fishwild.vt.edu/snakeheads/people.html\">John Odenkirk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/\">Virginia Department of Game & Inland</a> Fisheries (VDGIF) biologist, the bass population in the Potomac River is better now than in recent years. I interviewed Odenkirk regarding snakeheads in the Potomac River, and his interview, lightly edited, is below: <strong>KA:</strong> Which section of the Potomac River has the densest population of snakeheads? <strong>JO:</strong> The areas further downstream (away from D.C.), in newer colonized areas (with suitable habitat), generally will have higher numbers \u2014 these will usually be found in the back of tributary arms between Occoquan and Colonial Beach within both Maryland and Virginia. Areas closer to D.C. with higher numbers in Virginia are Aquia Creek (Stafford Co.) and the Occoquan River. <strong>KA:</strong> During the past few years, has the population of snakeheads increased, decreased, or remained the same in the Potomac River? Has increased fishing pressure helped to reduce the snakehead population? <strong>JO:</strong> Snakehead abundance increased dramatically after colonization, but trends suggest that increases in abundance may have slowed. Population estimates for Little Hunting Creek (tidal tributary of the Potomac River) declined each year from 2013 to 2015, supporting the assertion that northern snakehead density increases have slowed or that density has stabilized in some creeks. In the areas where they have been longest (e.g., around Mount Vernon), numbers seem to be declining in most Virginia creeks. I am fairly certain that a high level of exploitation (both commercial and recreational), which encompasses the huge increase in bow fishing, due to this fish, has helped suppress numbers. <strong>KA:</strong> During the past few years, has the population of game fish, such as bass and walleye, increased, decreased, or remained the same in sections of the Potomac River which have snakeheads? <strong>JO:</strong> We never see walleye in the Virginia portion of the tidal Potomac. This year, the largemouth bass population looks fantastic. On balance, the bass fishery has been better in the past five or six years than longer ago (during early phase of snakehead expansion). In short, it appears both populations are functioning completely independently of one another with no competition (plenty of forage to support both at current levels). <strong>KA:</strong> Snakeheads are fun to catch and are also delicious to eat. Is there a chance they will ever get reclassified as a game fish, with trophy citations awarded? <strong>JO:</strong> Maybe someday. Probably citations before game fish status, if it happens. <strong>KA:</strong> What is the largest or heaviest snakehead documented to have been harvested in the Potomac River? <strong>JO:</strong> We don\u2019t track those numbers officially, but it\u2019s in the 17- to 18-pound range. <strong>KA:</strong> Do snakeheads pose more of a risk to the ecosystem of lakes, such as Burke Lake and Lake Brittle, than to the ecosystem of a large river, such as the Potomac? <strong>JO:</strong> We hope not and should have an answer in a few years, as folks have illegally stocked them in both these VDGIF-owned lakes. We have copious historical data from which to gauge community response. Both lakes are productive (fertile) systems. One concern some folks have is with illegal introductions in less productive systems. <strong>KA:</strong> When were snakeheads first found in the Potomac River? <strong>JO:</strong> The fish was first found in the Potomac River in May 2004.

It\u2019s a role that seems to have grown since June 2011, when Chavez, speaking on national television from Havana, first revealed that he had undergone surgery on the island to remove a tumor. \u201cI have to tell you that my indignation grows every day,\u201d said Adicea Castillo, 75, an economist who helped topple Venezuela\u2019s last dictatorship in 1958 and said she was once supportive of Fidel Castro. <span>\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous to see a government and a president so beholden in this way to Cuba.\u201d</span> Cuba\u2019s influence on Venezuela is well known here. Over Chavez\u2019s 14 years in power, Cuba has sent sports trainers and doctors to Venezuela\u2019s poor barrios and provided intelligence agents to this country\u2019s military. Venezuela has reciprocated with 100,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate prices, an economic lifeline that analysts say has helped keep the Castro regime afloat. Chavez\u2019s government has also worked tirelessly for Cuba to be accepted by other Latin American countries, an effort that paid off last month when President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of a 14-month-old regional bloc called the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. But Chavez\u2019s cancer has drawn the two countries even closer, with the president spending more and more time in Havana as doctors grapple with a tumor that appears to have fended off four surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Indeed, Chavez was last seen in Venezuela on Dec. 10, when he boarded an early-morning flight to Havana. He missed his Jan. 10 swearing-in for a fourth term and, until photographs of him were released Friday, no one aside from a small cabal of aides and family members knew for sure whether he was even alive. <span></span>What Venezuelans do know is that the country\u2019s top leaders have taken to flying constantly to Cuba to meet with Chavez. Those associates say Chavez has provided them with detailed instructions on running the state. But critics say that Chavez has been in no condition to govern and that Cuba\u2019s government is helping plot Venezuela\u2019s course. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Venezuela has no precedent in our history,\u201d said Maria Corina Machado, an outspoken anti-Chavez lawmaker. \u201cFor the first time in 200 years of republican history, the decisions regarding the destiny of our country are being taken abroad.\u201d Such accusations have angered Venezuelan officials, who call the relationship with Cuba \u201ca brotherhood\u201d based on mutual respect. But the government\u2019s annoyance at the criticism has done little to curb growing resentment among some Venezuelans. In recent days, university students have chained themselves outside the Cuban embassy, which has drawn other protesters angry about Chavez\u2019s long sojourn in Havana. With a phalanx of National Guard troops protecting the embassy, the students have been sleeping on cushions and blankets in the middle of the street. They say they won\u2019t leave until they have clear answers about the president\u2019s health. For the protesters, the photographs issued by Chavez\u2019s aides proved nothing. They noted that the government still has not said what kind of cancer Chavez has nor revealed details about his prognosis or whether he will even return to Caracas. \u201cWe Venezuelans are living a great uncertainty, really, because we don\u2019t know the truth,\u201d said Gustavo Frias, 23, who spent the weekend at the embassy with other students. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the president is, if he\u2019s fine, if he\u2019s alive, if he\u2019s dead. The truth is what we want to know.\u201d "}], "saliency": [{"id": 80710.0, "text": "Fidel Castro", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Fidel Castro", "entityid": 38301}, {"id": 80720.0, "text": "Havana", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Havana", "entityid": 49719}, {"id": 80730.0, "text": "Raul Castro", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Ra%C3%BAl Castro", "entityid": 49719}, {"id": 80740.0, "text": "Community of Latin American and Caribbean States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Community of Latin American and Caribbean States", "entityid": 26313243}, {"id": 80750.0, "text": "Granma", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Granma (newspaper)", "entityid": 3335905}, {"id": 80760.0, "text": "Chavez", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Hugo Ch%C3%A1vez", "entityid": 3335905}, {"id": 80770.0, "text": "Cuban", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Cuba", "entityid": 5042481}, {"id": 80780.0, "text": "Venezuelan", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Venezuela", "entityid": 32374}, {"id": 80790.0, "text": "Maria Corina Machado", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mar%C3%ADa Corina Machado", "entityid": 32374}, {"id": 80710.0, "text": "Caracas", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Caracas", "entityid": 55289}, {"id": 80711.0, "text": "National Guard", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Venezuelan National Guard ", "entityid": 55289}]}

In fact, one could argue that this influx of Western money has helped preserve the dictatorship, as just about all the financial transactions go through the government, which takes for itself before any trickle-down crumbs are allowed to reach the \u00adregime-indentured masses. My view is that police-state control of every aspect of Cuban life is so thoroughly perfected that outside influences, whether confrontational or cooperative, only minimally affect the country\u2019s domestic trajectory. So why not just lift the embargo? After all, the unassailable strategic rationale for isolating Cuba \u2014 in the Soviets\u2019 mortal global struggle with us, Cuba enlisted as a highly committed enemy beachhead 90 miles from American shores \u2014 evaporated with the collapse of the Soviet empire. A small island with no significant independent military capacities, Cuba became geopolitically irrelevant. That\u2019s been partially reversed in the past few years as Vladimir Putin has repositioned Russia as America\u2019s leading geopolitical adversary and the Castros signed up for that coalition too. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-cuba-us-russia-20141218-story.html\" title=\"www.latimes.com\">Cuba has reportedly agreed to reopen </a>the Soviet-era Lourdes espionage facility, a massive listening post for intercepting communications. Havana and Moscow have also discussed the use of Cuban airfields for Russia\u2019s nuclear-capable long-range bombers. This in addition to Cuba\u2019s usual hemispheric mischief, such as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/cuba-has-outsized-role-in-venezuela-as-chavez-fights-cancer/2013/02/17/11915bd8-7944-11e2-9c27-fdd594ea6286_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">training and equipping</a> the security and repression apparatus in Venezuela. No mortal threat, I grant you. And not enough to justify forever cutting off Cuba.

These provided us with significant leverage in supporting the dissident movements in Eastern Europe that eventually brought down communist rule. If Obama insisted on giving away the store, why not at least do it item by item? We relax part of the embargo in return for, say, Internet access. And tie further normalization to serial relaxations of police-state repression. Oh, what hypocrisy, say the Obama acolytes. Did we not normalize relations with China and get no human rights quid pro quo? True. But that was never a prospect.

The jury of seven women and five men rendered its decision after deliberating for more than 14 hours. As the verdict was read, the bomber, 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, displayed no sign of emotion. The outcome was a victory for prosecutors, who said the former college student worked in tandem with his older brother and carried out the attack in a \u201cheinous, cruel and depraved manner.\u201d Jurors rejected arguments that Tsarnaev had fallen under the sway of his brother, Tamerlan, and was remorseful over the suffering he caused. Tsarnaev will be transferred to a federal prison, where he will remain until he is put to death by lethal injection. His attorneys did not comment after the verdict, but they are expected to appeal the sentence. After the verdict, Karen Brassard, who was wounded in the attack, said there was \u201cnothing happy about having to take someone\u2019s life.\u201d But she called the outcome \u201ca just conclusion.\u201d \u201cRight now, it feels like we can take a breath and breathe again,\u201d she said. Tsarnaev will become the 62nd federal inmate on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. But it has been more than a decade since the federal government executed an inmate, and the Obama administration is reviewing its protocol for carrying out the death penalty after a botched Oklahoma state execution last year. But the Justice Department, under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., decided last year to seek the death penalty in Tsarnaev\u2019s case. After Friday\u2019s verdict was read, Holder\u2019s successor, \u00adLoretta E. Lynch, issued a statement calling the sentence \u201cthe ultimate penalty\u201d and \u201ca fitting punishment for this horrific crime.\u201d Tsarnaev faced the possibility of death on 17 charges and was sentenced to death on six of them. Prosecutors had depicted him as a cold-blooded killer, repeatedly arguing that his placement of explosives near a young child was evidence of his depravity and one of the aggravating factors that supported a death sentence. Eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three people killed in the April 15, 2013, bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. More than 260 others were injured; 17 of them lost limbs. Tsarnaev was also charged with killing Sean Collier, a police officer employed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the aftermath of the attack. Although jurors found Tsarnaev guilty of murdering Collier, they did not sentence him to die on that count, a disappointment for prosecutors and the law enforcement community. Throughout the trial, prosecutors emphasized the scope of the carnage to jurors, outlining the death and destruction in graphic detail. \u201cThis is not a day of celebration. It is a day of reflection and healing,\u201d Carmen M. Ortiz, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, told reporters after the verdict. \u201cIt is time to turn the page.\u201d Prosecutors argued that Tsarnaev and his brother \u2014 who died in a shootout with police days after the bombings \u2014 were inspired by radical Islam and moved to violence out of a sense of vengeance over the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the boat where the younger Tsarnaev was eventually captured, authorities found a note: \u201cStop killing our innocent people and we will stop.\u201d \u201cThose are the words of a terrorist convinced that he has done the right thing,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Mellin told the jury. \u201cHe felt justified in killing and maiming and seriously injuring innocent men, women and children.\u201d In April, the jury that sentenced Tsarnaev had found him guilty of all 30 charges he faced in connection with the 2013 bombings, one of the worst terrorist attacks in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings. Although Tsarnaev\u2019s attorneys never contested that he was involved in the bombings, they mounted a vigorous defense during the penalty phase of the trial, seeking to convince jurors that mitigating factors demanded that they spare his life. Central to that argument was the notion that he was naive and impressionable \u2014 he was 19 at the time of the attack \u2014 and merely following Tamerlan, whom the attorneys depicted as the mastermind of the plot. Defense attorneys also argued that the younger Tsarnaev deeply regretted his actions. The vast majority of the jurors did not accept those arguments. Only two found that he had \u201cexpressed sorrow and remorse for what he did and for the suffering he caused,\u201d according to the lengthy verdict form read aloud in court. Only three jurors found that he was under the influence of his brother and would not have committed the crimes but for Tamerlan. Tsarnaev\u2019s legal team included attorneys with deep experience in capital cases. One of them, Judy Clarke, had previously persuaded juries to spare the lives of clients facing the death penalty, including Sept. 11, 2001, conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. If sentenced to life, Tsarnaev would have been held at a Supermax prison that has been described by a former warden as a \u201cversion of hell\u201d and a place that \u201cis not designed for humanity.\u201d His attorneys used such descriptions to argue before the jury that a life sentence would not be a reprieve. Clarke told the jury that a life sentence would allow \u201cfor the possibility of redemption and a greater opportunity for healing f<span>or everyone involved.\u201d</span> \u201cMercy\u2019s never earned, it\u2019s bestowed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the law allows you to choose justice and mercy.\u201d <span>Victi</span>ms of the marathon bombings were divided on the sentence. Although some argued publicly that they believed Tsarnaev deserved the death penalty, others \u2014 including the family of the 8-year-old boy \u2014 called for his life to be spared. Ortiz said she took their views seriously. For other survivors and relatives of victims, a life sentence would have proved insufficient. Said Michael Ward, a firefighter who was watching the marathon in 2013 and who helped victims after the explosions: \u201cThis nothing to celebrate. This is a matter of justice.\u201d Tsarnaev \u201cwanted to go to hell,\u201d he said, \u201cand he\u2019s going to get there early.\u201d Mark Berman and Sari Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report.

And it is not the judiciary\u2019s business to worry that a ruling might seem to \u201ccountenance\u201d this or that social advocacy. The conservative case against capital punishment, which 32 states have, is threefold. First, the power to inflict death cloaks government with a majesty and pretense of infallibility discordant with conservatism. Second, when capital punishment is inflicted, it cannot later be corrected because of new evidence, so a capital punishment regime must be administered with extraordinary competence. It is, however, a government program. Since 1973, more than 140 people sentenced to death have been acquitted of their crimes (sometimes by DNA evidence), had the charges against them dismissed by prosecutors or have been pardoned based on evidence of innocence. For an unsparing immersion in the workings of the governmental machinery of death, read \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812994523/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0812994523&linkCode=as2&tag=thewaspos09-20&linkId=5WKMIDTKMJZ2RK6M\" title=\"www.amazon.com\">Just Mercy</a>\u201d by Bryan Stevenson, executive director and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative. Third, administration of death sentences is so sporadic and protracted that their power to deter is attenuated. And the expensive, because labyrinthine, legal protocols with which the judiciary has enveloped capital punishment are here to stay. Granted, capital punishment <i>could</i> deter: If overdue library books were punishable by death, none would be overdue. But many crimes <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/02/25/can-life-in-prison-might-be-worse-than-death-some-tsarnaev-jurors-think-so/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">for which death is reserved</a>, including Tsarnaev\u2019s crime of ideological premeditation, are especially difficult to deter. Those who favor capital punishment because of its supposed deterrent effect do not favor strengthening that effect by restoring the practice of public executions. There has not been one in America since 1937 (a hanging in Galena, Mo.) because society has decided that state-inflicted deaths, far from being wholesomely didactic spectacles, are coarsening and revolting.

For Davis, then chief military prosecutor at the top-security facility, the end of the suspects\u2019 detention at secret CIA prisons overseas promised a credible legal reckoning in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cI want our grandchildren to look at Guantanamo the way we look back at Nuremberg,\u201d Davis told the lawyers on his team, offering as a model the prosecution of Nazi officials that followed World War II. \u201cWe felt we had the ability to conduct these trials in a way that .\u2009.\u2009. the country would be proud of.\u201d Ten years later, none of those 14 \u201chigh value\u201d detainees brought to Guantanamo Bay have been convicted or sentenced in the military commissions. Roughly half a dozen cases tried in other commission proceedings have resulted in convictions, but most have been thrown out on appeal. A clutch of cases is moving so slowly in preliminary proceedings that the trial of five suspects accused of organizing the 9/11 attacks is expected to begin at the earliest in 2020, nearly 20 years after hijacked planes struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the same period, hundreds of terrorism suspects have been convicted in federal courts, including members of al-Qaeda captured overseas. But Congress has barred the Obama administration from moving any Guantanamo detainees into the United States, which leaves offshore military commissions as the only legal process available to prosecute them. The administration had planned to prosecute the 9/11 defendants in federal court in New York, but after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/guantanamo-bay-how-the-white-house-lost-the-fight-to-close-it/2011/04/14/AFtxR5XE_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">congressional and local opposition</a>, their cases were returned to the military legal system in 2011.

Despite President Obama\u2019s effort to improve the commissions by giving inmates greater due process, legal experts and lawyers who have been involved in the trials say the system may be irreparably flawed. Some lawyers say that even if the cases can be concluded, the process is now seen as so tainted that those verdicts may be publicly dismissed. \u201cThe fact that we are here in 2016, probably further from trial than we were in 2011, tells you that this is an experiment that failed,\u201d said Richard Kammen, a civilian defense lawyer for one of the high-value detainees. Lt. Col. Valerie Henderson, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said military judges and lawyers have been working to put the necessary pieces in place for the eventual trials to begin. \u201cThe Department of Defense is committed to fairness and transparency in the military commissions proceedings,\u201d she said. In 2009, Obama <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-national-security-5-21-09\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.whitehouse.gov\">laid out his plan </a>for \u201ccleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess,\u201d referring to the prison and trial process set up under President Bush, who brought hundreds of detainees to Guantanamo in the months after the 9/11 attacks. \u201cAs president, I refuse to allow this problem to fester,\u201d Obama vowed. \u201cI refuse to pass it on to somebody else.\u201d When Brig. Gen. Mark Martins became the commissions\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/brig-gen-mark-martins-lead-prosecutor-in-911-case-in-fight-of-his-career/2012/05/04/gIQAtNc50T_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">lead prosecutor</a> in 2011, he asked the public for patience as he sought to demonstrate that the commissions could provide authentic justice despite the legacy of torture, the complexity of the cases and the challenge of handling a large volume of classified materials. Martins declined to comment for this article. Perched in a remote corner of Cuba and accessible only by U.S. military transport, the Guantanamo prison\u2019s very location has been an important factor in slowing the pace of the trials. When lawyers travel to the island for periodic proceedings or client meetings, they must hitch a ride on military planes and stay for several days at a time. When they speak to the detainees, the materials they bring in and out of meetings are closely screened. Despite Pentagon denials, defense lawyers also suspect that communications with their clients continue to be monitored. Defense lawyers describe a \u201cdown the rabbit hole\u201d process in which they lack<b></b> normal access to evidence, including what their clients said and did during their years-long detentions at extrajudicial prisons overseas, as well as evidence seized during counterterrorism raids. Legal experts also say the untested nature of the commission system, which unlike civilian courts is operating without the benefit of relevant legal precedents to guide it, has slowed the process. \u201cWe\u2019re 13 years down the road, and you\u2019re just now getting the defendants\u2019 statements to the judge,\u201d said David Nevin, a civilian defense lawyer for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/khalid-sheik-mohammed-to-face-death-penalty-trial/2012/04/04/gIQALLHOvS_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Khalid Sheik Mohammed</a>, described as the 9/11 mastermind. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing if you\u2019ve been around the criminal justice system.\u201d Earlier this year, defense lawyers learned that a judge had secretly allowed the prosecution to destroy evidence related to a CIA prison, reversing a previous judge\u2019s order without notifying them. It remains unclear what material from a 2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/senate-report-on-cia-program-details-brutality-dishonesty/2014/12/09/1075c726-7f0e-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Senate Intelligence Committee report </a>on the CIA interrogation program will be permitted in the eventual trials and sentencing proceedings. That investigation showed that some detainees at the CIA\u2019s secret \u201cblack sites\u201d were subjected to extreme measures, including \u201cnear drownings\u201d and \u201crectal rehydration.\u201d Some lawyers say the system has fundamentally different goals than the civilian courts. \u201cIt is not a justice system in the way we in the U.S. think about it,\u201d said James Connell, an attorney for Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, one of the 9/11 defendants. \u201cIt is instead a hybrid specialized system that was set up with the purpose of concealing evidence of torture.\u201d The White House declined to comment on the commissions, which many senior officials also view as flawed. Defense lawyers said they don\u2019t know what considerations will be made in court for the mistreatment of detainees. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/alleged-uss-cole-bombing-mastermind-nashiri-is-arraigned/2011/11/09/gIQAUn5i5M_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">accused in the 2000 attack on a U.S. ship off Yemen</a>, was tortured while in CIA custody and has not received meaningful treatment for the significant psychological and physical effects he has suffered, said Kammen, one of his defense lawyers. \u201cNashiri is profoundly damaged by what the CIA did to him,\u201d he said. It\u2019s also possible that the trials will eventually be dropped, if political leaders decide that they are unfeasible or if moving forward would force the government to disclose information seen as too damaging. Many legal experts say transfer to federal courts is the only solution. Such courts have proved that they can handle complex terrorism cases, like that of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-boston-marathon-bomber/2015/05/15/30a493b8-fb07-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">sentenced to death </a>two years after the crime. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost sight of the basic question, which is: Why are we trying these people?\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and a former Guantanamo defense lawyer. \u201cIf the answer is to obtain some measure of justice for their heinous acts, the question the next president has to ask is whether it\u2019s more likely .\u2009.\u2009. in a federal system or a Guantanamo military commission,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that question answers itself.\u201d Julie Tate contributed to this report.

While officials have not connected the attacks to international terrorism, the use of pressure cookers as explosive devices has been recognized for years by counterterrorism experts because it has been touted by al-Qaeda. Similarly constructed devices have been deployed by terrorists in bombings around the world, from the 2013 Boston Marathon to attacks in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. Pressure cookers have also been tied to al-Qaeda because the first edition of Inspire magazine, produced by the group\u2019s Yemeni affiliate, included an article teaching people how to make pressure-cooker bombs. It was titled \u201cMake a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom.\u201d The same 2010 issue also explained, with step-by-step photographs, how to assemble pipe bombs. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security sent <a href=\"http://www.5nr.org/downloads/notice/PotentialTerrorist.pdf\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.5nr.org\">a bulletin</a>, \u201cPotential Terrorist Use of Pressure Cookers,\u201d to law enforcement. It warned that pressure cookers, \u201ca common cooking utensil,\u201d were often overlooked in searches of vehicles, houses or people crossing U.S. borders. The bulletin also said that explosive material inside a pressure cooker could be detonated \u201cusing simple electronic components including, but not limited to, digital watches, garage door openers, cell phones or pagers.\u201d The first pressure-cooker bomb in New York this weekend, which exploded on 23rd Street in Manhattan on Saturday night, contained Tannerite, a substance that includes ammonium nitrate and is used primarily for making exploding targets for firearms practice. Tannerite is not regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It consists of two components that are allowed to be legally purchased because neither is an explosive by itself. Common pressure cookers of the kind found at most discount stores were used for the two bombs that went off at the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/boston-marathon-bombs-had-simple-but-harmful-design-early-clues-indicate/2013/04/16/c2b061cc-a6d8-11e2-8302-3c7e0ea97057_story.html\">Boston Marathon</a>. They were armed with simple detonators and were packed with an explosive, along with BBs, nails and pellets to cause more casualties. Investigators say the first New York bomb contained similar material. The second explosive device, found on 27th Street by passersby who called the police, was also a pressure-cooker-type bomb with wiring, according to law enforcement officials. It did not detonate. About 11 hours earlier, at about 9:30 a.m., pipe bombs exploded in a garbage can shortly before a charity 5K race in Seaside Park, N.J., on the Jersey Shore, to benefit Marines and Navy sailors. Such bombs use a tightly sealed section of pipe to hold explosive material. The material found inside the New Jersey pipe bombs was black powder, according to law enforcement officials. The three pipe bombs were constructed using Christmas lights. A cellphone can be wired to the lights, which serve as a match to ignite the explosives when a call is made to the phone, explained one explosives expert, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and so spoke on the condition of anonymity. The cellphone can also be used as a timer to set off the bomb. The Boston Marathon bombers, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-boston-marathon-bomber/2015/05/15/30a493b8-fb07-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Dzhokhar</a> and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, also used Christmas lights as improvised fuses. The multiple explosive devices that were found in a backpack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, N.J., also included pipe bombs. New York police officials said the pressure-cooker-type device found on 27th Street was rendered safe at a facility in the Bronx. That device and materials from Seaside Park were sent to the FBI\u2019s lab in Quantico, Va., where they will be analyzed, along with the remnants of the device that exploded in New York, authorities said. The FBI has linked a suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, to the New York and New Jersey bombs. Rahami, 28, was arrested Monday in Linden, N.J., after being wounded in a shootout with police. He was taken to a hospital. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said the FBI told him that the bomber made similar mistakes with more than one of the devices that caused them not to detonate properly. King said the FBI used fingerprints and a cellphone attached to one of the pressure cookers to track down another cellphone that belonged to the suspect. \u201cFBI took me into the crime scene\u201d on 27th Street, King said. \u201cThey must have had 40 to 50 personnel on hands and knees. It\u2019s an incredible scene. Every single ball bearing and piece of evidence, they\u2019re putting a little white paper cone over it. So you just see this field littered in dozens of white cones.\u201d Law enforcement officials said the New York bombing, which injured more than two dozen people, could have been much worse. Because the bomber placed the device under a garbage bin, the can took the force of the blast and absorbed the fragmentation of the shrapnel. \u201cThe dumpster that was exploded was thrown down the street 175 feet, to give you an idea of how powerful it was,\u201d King said. \u201cYou had ball bearings everywhere. If the streets had been crowded, there would have been bad injuries. There were windows broken as high as the third floor.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

We are re-upping this post from April 17.</em> Martin Richard was 8 years old on April 15, 2013, when he was killed by a bomb placed near his family along the final few hundred yards of the Boston Marathon. The man who planted the bomb, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was just found guilty of the crime and might now face the death penalty. But Martin's parents, Bill and Denise Richard, oppose the death penalty for Tsarnaev, as they explained in a brief, direct essay <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/16/end-anguish-drop-death-penalty/ocQLejp8H2vesDavItHIEN/story.html#\">in the Boston Globe</a>. It's not because they oppose the death penalty, necessarily, but because they can't bear several more years of debate as an appeal from Tsarnaev makes its way through the courts. We reported Friday morning that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/17/most-americans-support-the-death-penalty-they-also-agree-that-an-innocent-person-might-get-put-to-death/\">support for the death penalty itself</a> continues to slip downward, particularly among Democrats. Americans generally have a complex array of beliefs about the topic (as they do so many other things), but the long-term trend is clear. In 1995, two decades after the death penalty was reinstated and just past the peak of America's crime wave, support for the death penalty hit 78 percent. Now, it's at 56 percent. But again, that's not the Richards' objection. \"We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table,\" they write, \"in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal.\" Later, they add: In part because of the nature of the irreversible punishment, the appeals process for death penalty cases has grown longer and longer. Data from the <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/cp12st.pdf\">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> shows that the average time between sentencing and execution was nearly 16 years in 2012, up from about six in the early 1980s. It has been two years since Martin Richard was killed. Rather than face the prospect of spending perhaps another two decades reintroducing the same evidence, hearing the same story of the moments before and after their little boy was murdered, the Richard family would like to put it behind them. They'd rather sacrifice the \"ultimate punishment\" than spend twice as long discussing their son's death as they spent enjoying his short life. "}], "saliency": []}

This week, however, they were told to answer another question: What should happen to him? Before the jurors began their deliberations, District Judge George A. O\u2019Toole Jr. reminded them that they had to decide if Tsarnaev would spend the rest of his life in prison or if he should be executed by the federal government. \u201cThe choice between these very serious alternatives is yours, and yours alone, to make,\u201d O\u2019Toole said Wednesday. <em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-boston-marathon-bomber/2015/05/15/30a493b8-fb07-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html?hpid=z1\">[Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sentenced to death]</a></em> The jury found Tsarnaev guilty last month on 30 counts, 17 of which carried the death penalty. A death sentence on any of these counts had to be unanimous, because if even one juror chose life imprisonment over death, the sentence for that count would automatically be life in prison. The jurors were told to consider two sets of factors when considering the sentence. Aggravating factors were anything that could support a death sentence, while mitigating factors would argue for life imprisonment instead. One bombing victim in particular \u2014 8-year-old Martin Richard \u2014 was cited repeatedly as an aggravating factor. The federal death penalty statute notes that a victim who is very young or old can be considered particularly vulnerable, and Richard\u2019s youth was emphasized by the government in its decision to seek the death penalty and again during the trial. During the closing arguments this week, prosecutors again pointed to the harrowing scene confronting Richard during the blasts. However, after Tsarnaev was found guilty, Richard\u2019s parents <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/17/parents-of-child-killed-in-boston-marathon-bombing-ask-government-to-stop-seeking-the-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote an open letter</a> asking the federal government to stop seeking the death penalty.

The day they began deliberating on how to sentence Tsarnaev, they told O\u2019Toole that they had insulated themselves as much as possible from any media coverage of the case. Prosecutors this week used their last chance to address the jurors to detail the scope of the carnage of the bombings and the aftermath, outlining the death and destruction that occurred on Boylston Street and beyond. \u201cHe killed indiscriminately to make a political statement, and he placed no value on the lives and didn\u2019t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends,\u201d Steven D. Mellin, a U.S. attorney, said during the government\u2019s closing arguments. \u201cHis actions have earned him a sentence of death.\u201d The defense, meanwhile, staked its case on what they considered mitigating factors, such as Tsarnaev\u2019s youth (he was 19 when the bombing occurred) and, crucially, the argument that he was under the sway of his older brother, Tamerlan. Judy Clarke, the defense attorney who bluntly stated \u201cIt was him\u201d during her opening statements, used her closing argument to paint a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev\u2019s \u201csole source of family, of support, of strength.\u201d She described the older brother as bigger and possessing more charisma, laying out examples of how Dzhokhar was influenced by Tamerlan. \u201cThe horrific events of the Boston Marathon bombing cannot be told or understood in any degree of reality without talking about Tamerlan,\u201d she said. Clarke also described Tsarnaev\u2019s \u201cpotential for redemption,\u201d pointing to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/11/boston-marathon-bomber-genuinely-sorry-sister-helen-prejean-tells-jurors/\" target=\"_blank\">the testimony earlier this week</a> of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and death-penalty opponent. And Clarke told the jurors that each of them was a safeguard against a death sentence. \u201cThe law values life, and you have no obligation to vote for death,\u201d she said. Before agreeing on a sentence, the jurors had to first agree that Tsarnaev was 18 years old, because the federal death penalty statute prohibits a death sentence for anyone younger than that age when they committed the crime in question. They were told to consider only the evidence presented in the trial, and told not to factor in anything they may have read in the media, summations offered by attorneys in the case or the government\u2019s indictment of Tsarnaev. O\u2019Toole also told the jurors that they had to decide if the government proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt and to your unanimous satisfaction\u201d that aggravating factors were at work in this case. Only if they agreed on this should they sentence him to death, the judge said. Ultimately, as O\u2019Toole outlined this week, each juror had to decide what they individually believed after the trial. It took about 14 hours of deliberations before every juror agreed to make Tsarnaev the 62nd person on federal death row. "}], "saliency": []}

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, supported treating Tsarnaev and Mohammed as the same sort of threat to the country -- an \"enemy combatant\" -- but opposed giving Mohammed the same sort of trial. Shortly after the Boston attacks, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) joined Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) and Graham in making an unusual demand -- that Tsarnaev should be held as an enemy combatant, which is Mohammed's legal status. The group <a href=\"http://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorGraham.Blog&ContentRecord_id=3831571b-e434-aa12-7961-8b55d3f5ba32\">released a statement</a> making its case while Tsarnaev was still recovering from his wounds from the police pursuit in a Boston hospital. \"The suspect, based upon his actions,\" it read in part, \"clearly is a good candidate for enemy combatant status. We do not want this suspect to remain silent.\" At the time, questions about the extent to which Tsarnaev and his brother had help in committing their attack remained, as did debate over whether or not the terror suspect should have been given his Miranda rights. Holding Tsarnaev as a combatant would have allowed further, extended interrogation. \"We hope the Obama Administration will consider the enemy combatant option,\" the statement continued, \"because it is allowed by national security statutes and U.S. Supreme Court decisions.\" This was widely interpreted as an argument from the group that Tsarnaev should be <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/20/nation/la-na-nn-miranda-boston-bombing-suspect-20130420\">sent to Guantanamo</a> and face a military tribunal. The former seems never to have actually been argued; the latter was explicitly rejected. And Graham agreed with that call. \"The decision by the Obama administration to try this individual in federal court is a sound decision. It is the right decision,\" Graham said at <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/04/senator-graham-on-tsarnaev-and-miranda/\">a news conference</a> the following week. \"Military commission trials are not available in cases like this.\" Tsarnaev, an American citizen, was not eligible for such a trial under a law Graham himself wrote. In 2009, though, Graham opposed an Obama administration effort to bring Mohammed to trial in a federal court in Manhattan. The New Yorker's Jane Mayer <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/02/15/the-trial-2\">reported</a> that Graham had the ear of then-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel connected Graham with Attorney General Eric Holder to get him on-board with giving Mohammed the sort of trial Tsarnaev faced. It didn't work. \"It was a nonstarter for me,\" Graham told Mayer. \"There\u2019s a place for the courts, but not for the mastermind of 9/11. On balance, I think it would be better to close Guant\u00e1namo, but it would be better to keep it open than to give these guys civilian trials.\" <em>[<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/12/10/lawyers-for-911-suspects-say-cia-interrogation-report-could-help-their-cases/\">Lawyers for 9/11 suspects say CIA interrogation report could help their cases</a></em>] Mohammed, as the Huffington Post's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/599303493703356418\">Ryan Reilly noted</a>, was involved in discussions about getting his trial underway a year before the Tsarnaevs put their plot in motion.

However, it is worth remembering something: The government cannot actually execute anyone right now. The Justice Department effectively has a moratorium on executions because it is reviewing the federal death penalty policy. And even if the review immediately concluded that the federal protocol is fine as it stands, there is still the issue of the actual lethal injection drugs that would be needed for any execution. Federal officials say the Bureau of Prisons does not possess any doses of drugs intended for lethal injections because of this ongoing review, and these drugs are increasingly difficult for authorities to obtain. [<em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/15/how-a-jury-decided-to-sentence-the-boston-marathon-bomber-to-death/?hpid=z1\">How a jury decided to sentence the Boston Marathon bomber to death</a></em>] \u201cThe Department of Justice has been conducting a review of the federal protocol used by the Bureau of Prisons, and has had a moratorium in place on federal executions in the meantime,\u201d Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement. Of course, there is likely a long appeals process ahead for Tsarnaev. His attorneys did not speak after he was sentenced, but they are expected to appeal the sentence; this process could be lengthy, which would delay the government actually confronting this issue in the case. Federal death sentences are not frequently handed down, and inmates who arrive on death row often remain there for a while. There were 61 inmates on federal death row going into Tsarnaev\u2019s sentencing, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. More than half of them were sentenced at least a decade ago, and 10 of them were sentenced before 2000. <em>[<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/17/parents-of-child-killed-in-boston-marathon-bombing-ask-government-to-stop-seeking-the-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">Parents of 8-year-old bombing victim asked government to drop the death penalty</a>]</em> Still, this federal review points to larger issues facing the country\u2019s capital punishment system in recent years. This review stems, in part, from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/\" target=\"_blank\">an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs</a> that has pushed the issue of capital punishment back into the news and back to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is rare for someone to receive a federal death sentence and even more unusual for that sentence to actually be carried out. Since the federal death penalty statute was reinstated in 1988 and expanded in 1994, three inmates have been put to death by the government, all of them were by lethal injection. Even when the government does seek a death sentence, judges and juries rarely impose it, having opted for a life sentence in about two-thirds of these trials, according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project. The three inmates who have been executed were all put to death more than a decade ago. Timothy McVeigh was executed in 2001 for the Oklahoma City bombing, while Juan Raul Garza was executed a little more than a week later for murdering three men. <i>[<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/15/attorney-general-death-sentence-is-a-fitting-punishment-for-boston-marathon-bomber/\">Full statement from Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch</a>]</i> The last time that someone in federal custody was put to death was in 2003, according to Justice Department officials, when Louis Jones Jr. was executed. The Gulf War veteran was convicted for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of an Army recruit, 19-year-old Tracie Joy McBride. All three executions were carried out using three drugs that are listed in the execution protocol that the federal Bureau of Prisons has in place \u2014 the same protocol that is under review and cannot be used. Under this protocol, condemned inmates must be brought into the execution chamber 30 minutes before the lethal injection is scheduled to begin. The protocol also calls for three sets of syringes containing the lethal drugs, one for the execution and another meant as a backup. The first drug in the protocol, sodium thiopental, is meant to render the inmate unconscious. After that, pancurium bromide (a paralytic) and potassium chloride (which stops the heart) are supposed to be injected. This three-drug protocol resembles the same method used across the country until very recently, when an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/01/23/why-the-supreme-court-is-acting-on-lethal-injection-and-what-that-could-mean-for-the-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">fractured the way executions are carried out in the United States</a>.

One of the drugs the federal policy lists, sodium thiopental, was frequently used in executions across the country until the company that manufactured it <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/\" target=\"_blank\">stopped producing the drug</a> due to its use in capital punishment; it was last utilized in an execution in Alabama in 2011, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. One of these problematic recent executions saw an inmate in Oklahoma <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/05/02/what-it-was-like-watching-the-botched-oklahoma-execution/\" target=\"_blank\">writhe and grimace on the gurney</a> during his lethal injection before <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/04/29/oklahoma-execution-botched-inmate-still-dies-second-execution-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\">dying 43 minutes after</a> it began.

However, it is worth remembering something: The government cannot actually execute anyone right now. The Justice Department effectively has a moratorium on executions because it is reviewing the federal death penalty policy. And even if the review immediately concluded that the federal protocol is fine as it stands, there is still the issue of the actual lethal injection drugs that would be needed for any execution. Federal officials say the Bureau of Prisons does not possess any doses of drugs intended for lethal injections because of this ongoing review, and these drugs are increasingly difficult for authorities to obtain. [<em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/15/how-a-jury-decided-to-sentence-the-boston-marathon-bomber-to-death/?hpid=z1\">How a jury decided to sentence the Boston Marathon bomber to death</a></em>] \u201cThe Department of Justice has been conducting a review of the federal protocol used by the Bureau of Prisons, and has had a moratorium in place on federal executions in the meantime,\u201d Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement. Of course, there is likely a long appeals process ahead for Tsarnaev. His attorneys did not speak after he was sentenced, but they are expected to appeal the sentence; this process could be lengthy, which would delay the government actually confronting this issue in the case. Federal death sentences are not frequently handed down, and inmates who arrive on death row often remain there for a while. There were 61 inmates on federal death row going into Tsarnaev\u2019s sentencing, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. More than half of them were sentenced at least a decade ago, and 10 of them were sentenced before 2000. <em>[<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/17/parents-of-child-killed-in-boston-marathon-bombing-ask-government-to-stop-seeking-the-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">Parents of 8-year-old bombing victim asked government to drop the death penalty</a>]</em> Still, this federal review points to larger issues facing the country\u2019s capital punishment system in recent years. This review stems, in part, from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/\" target=\"_blank\">an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs</a> that has pushed the issue of capital punishment back into the news and back to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is rare for someone to receive a federal death sentence and even more unusual for that sentence to actually be carried out. Since the federal death penalty statute was reinstated in 1988 and expanded in 1994, three inmates have been put to death by the government, all of them were by lethal injection. Even when the government does seek a death sentence, judges and juries rarely impose it, having opted for a life sentence in about two-thirds of these trials, according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project. The three inmates who have been executed were all put to death more than a decade ago. Timothy McVeigh was executed in 2001 for the Oklahoma City bombing, while Juan Raul Garza was executed a little more than a week later for murdering three men. <i>[<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/15/attorney-general-death-sentence-is-a-fitting-punishment-for-boston-marathon-bomber/\">Full statement from Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch</a>]</i> The last time that someone in federal custody was put to death was in 2003, according to Justice Department officials, when Louis Jones Jr. was executed. The Gulf War veteran was convicted for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of an Army recruit, 19-year-old Tracie Joy McBride. All three executions were carried out using three drugs that are listed in the execution protocol that the federal Bureau of Prisons has in place \u2014 the same protocol that is under review and cannot be used. Under this protocol, condemned inmates must be brought into the execution chamber 30 minutes before the lethal injection is scheduled to begin. The protocol also calls for three sets of syringes containing the lethal drugs, one for the execution and another meant as a backup. The first drug in the protocol, sodium thiopental, is meant to render the inmate unconscious. After that, pancurium bromide (a paralytic) and potassium chloride (which stops the heart) are supposed to be injected. This three-drug protocol resembles the same method used across the country until very recently, when an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/01/23/why-the-supreme-court-is-acting-on-lethal-injection-and-what-that-could-mean-for-the-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">fractured the way executions are carried out in the United States</a>. As the shortage has continued, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/\" target=\"_blank\">states are scrambling to obtain the drugs</a> needed to carry out executions. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe that the federal government has better access to these drugs than any of the states do,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. \u201cIf the drugs aren\u2019t available, the drugs aren\u2019t available.\u201d States struggling to find execution drugs and have turned to new and untested drug combinations, resulting in some executions that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/07/24/another-execution-gone-awry-now-what/\" target=\"_blank\">seemingly went awry</a>. One of the drugs the federal policy lists, sodium thiopental, was frequently used in executions across the country until the company that manufactured it <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/\" target=\"_blank\">stopped producing the drug</a> due to its use in capital punishment; it was last utilized in an execution in Alabama in 2011, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. One of these problematic recent executions saw an inmate in Oklahoma <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/05/02/what-it-was-like-watching-the-botched-oklahoma-execution/\" target=\"_blank\">writhe and grimace on the gurney</a> during his lethal injection before <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/04/29/oklahoma-execution-botched-inmate-still-dies-second-execution-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\">dying 43 minutes after</a> it began.

On Friday, Azamat Tazhayakov, a friend of Tsarnaev\u2019s, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for impeding the investigation into the bombing. Tazhayakov was indicted four months after the bombing, because, authorities said, he and others went to Tsarnaev\u2019s dorm room and removed Tsarnaev\u2019s laptop, a backpack with fireworks and a thumb drive; the backpack was eventually thrown away, though FBI agents recovered it at a landfill a week later.

Prosecutors said that Kadyrbayev found the backpack with fireworks and that he took the backpack and laptop, along with other items, and later threw them away. Also on Friday, Robel Phillipos, a third Tsarnaev friend, is set to be sentenced for a different charge. He was convicted in October of lying to the FBI during the bombing investigation, because he had initially denied that he went to Tsarnaev\u2019s dorm room and saw the backpack being removed from the room.

It was not until the following January that then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that prosecutors would seek a death sentence. Federal death sentences are rare, and it is even more unusual for these sentences to be carried out. Three inmates have been put to death since the federal death penalty statute was reinstated in 1988 and expanded in 1994. And the federal government effectively <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-federal-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">has a moratorium on executions</a> while it reviews the federal death penalty policy.

Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said at the time that she would make a decision on a possible death sentence after meeting with relatives of the church victims. The federal government\u2019s death penalty statute says that one of the aggravating factors warranting a death sentence is when victims are particularly young or old; three of the victims of the shooting were between 70 and 87 years old. Roof was charged with federal hate crimes for attacking African American parishioners \u201cbecause of their race and in order to interfere with their exercise of their religion,\u201d Lynch said when announcing the charges last year. David Bruck, an attorney for Roof, told a judge last summer that Roof <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/31/accused-charleston-church-gunman-plans-to-plead-guilty-to-hate-crime-charges/\" target=\"_blank\">intends to plead guilty to the federal hate crime charges</a>, but could not enter that plea without knowing if the government would seek a death sentence. As a result, last summer Roof entered a not guilty plea that was essentially a temporary plea. Bruck said Thursday that Roof intends to plead guilty if the government does not seek a death sentence, saying that \u201cthe only obstacle is whether the government will insist on the death penalty,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article59753191.html\" target=\"_blank\">the State</a> reported. Decisions about whether to plead guilty or not guilty have been used in the past as a way to avoid a death sentence. In one high-profile example, Theodore J. Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, pleaded not guilty to charges until striking a deal the day opening arguments in his trial were set to begin. He pleaded guilty and agreed to life in prison without possibility of parole and evading the death penalty. <strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/09/12/an-american-void/\" target=\"_blank\">These are the people Roof stayed with before the shooting</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/05/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-federal-death-penalty/\" target=\"_blank\">The federal government cannot actually execute anybody</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/18/joey-meek-friend-of-dylann-roof-charged-in-connection-with-church-shooting/\" target=\"_blank\">Joey Meek, friend of Roof, pleads not guilty to federal charges</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/19/i-forgive-you-relatives-of-charleston-church-victims-address-dylann-roof/\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018I forgive you.\u2019 Relatives of Charleston church shooting victims address Roof</a> "}], "saliency": []}

Holder Jr. announced that prosecutors would seek a death sentence the following year. The Justice Department declined to comment Tuesday. Federal death sentences are rarely handed down and even more rarely carried out. Three inmates have been put to death since the federal death penalty statute was reinstated in 1988 and expanded in 1994.

Clementa Pinckney, the church\u2019s pastor, \u201cover and over again.\u201d More than a year after the shooting, Roof is in court for the first of two trials. (He has also been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/07/07/dylann-roof-indicted-on-charges-of-murder-and-attempted-murder/?utm_term=.26b45fe0964a\" target=\"_blank\">charged with murder</a> in state court, and faces trial on that next year.) Authorities say Roof confessed to the killings of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/charleston-church-shooting-victims/?tid=a_inl\" target=\"_blank\">nine black parishioners at the Mother Emanuel church</a>. His guilt in the trial is effectively unchallenged. An attorney for Roof did not argue with the facts detailed by the federal government Wednesday, and they have offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison. Prosecutors have not accepted that offer. Instead, they are still <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/05/24/justice-dept-will-seek-death-penalty-for-accused-charleston-church-gunman-dylann-roof/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.a54a127a0b84\" target=\"_blank\">seeking a rare federal death sentence</a> in the case, a decision that has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/we-are-just-looking-for-justice-charleston-prepares-for-dylann-roofs-trial/2016/12/06/4396d6a0-bbba-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html?utm_term=.21e8b687f4b7\" target=\"_blank\">caused unease among some families of the victims</a>. And if Roof is convicted and sentenced to die, it is not clear whether the government would be able to carry out the punishment. Federal death sentences are extremely rare, and executions are even less common. There are 62 inmates on federal death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based nonprofit, compared to nearly 3,000 condemned inmates in states nationwide. Since the federal death penalty statute was reinstated in 1988 and expanded in 1994, the government has put three inmates to death, all by lethal injection. The last federal execution was more than a decade ago. Louis Jones Jr., a Gulf War veteran, convicted of the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of Tracie Joy McBride, a 19-year-old Army recruit, was put to death in 2003. Two years before that, the government executed Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing and Juan Raul Garza for murdering three men. The government has taken a little more than 200 federal death penalty cases to trial since 1988, according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project. (Attorneys general had agreed to let prosecutors seek death sentences in more cases, but many of those ended with plea deals or the government opting not to pursue the death penalty, the project\u2019s records show.) In the federal cases that actually saw juries decide on a sentence, they opted for life imprisonment about twice as often as death sentences. Most recently, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-boston-marathon-bomber/2015/05/15/30a493b8-fb07-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html?hpid=z1\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced to death on federal charges last year</a> for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing. Tsarnaev, the newest addition to the federal death row, is being held at the federal penitentiary in Florence, Colo., according to the Bureau of Prisons. If he is put to death, he will be brought to the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., where federal death sentences are carried out. The Justice Department sought death for Tsarnaev last year and Roof this year, but it has also announced what is effectively a federal death penalty moratorium while officials review their policy; it does not look like this review will finish before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. President Obama has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/23/obama-calls-death-penalty-deeply-troubling-but-his-position-hasnt-budged/?utm_term=.004df5fc0ff2\" target=\"_blank\">called the death penalty \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d</a> but has remained in favor of using it for particularly heinous crimes, while Trump has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/10/donald-trump-wants-the-death-penalty-for-those-who-kill-police-officers/?utm_term=.a5cbe9becb3f\" target=\"_blank\">a vocal supporter</a> of the death penalty. Nationwide, polls have shown that American support for the death penalty has declined since peaking in the 1990s, and a survey earlier this year showed that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/30/states-arent-using-the-death-penalty-as-much-now-americans-are-abandoning-it-too/?utm_term=.e727535266a3\" target=\"_blank\">less than half of Americans supported the death penalty</a> for the first time in decades. (A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/most-americans-dont-like-the-death-penalty-right-wrong/2016/10/26/afd7e6c8-9b9a-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.9387cf1af4a3\" target=\"_blank\">different poll</a>, not long after, found stronger support for capital punishment.) Republicans still strongly back the death penalty, while a majority of Democrats oppose it. White people are much more likely than black or Hispanic people to support the practice, which <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/race-and-death-penalty\" target=\"_blank\">studies show has been</a> disproportionately sought for black inmates. In South Carolina, <a href=\"http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article83311012.html\" target=\"_blank\">a poll showed a similar racial split</a>, with most black people saying Roof should get life in prison and most white people saying he should be sentenced to death. But if Roof is condemned to die, it remains unclear when such a penalty could be carried out. The appeals process could stretch on for years, and whether he is actually executed could depend on the status of the death penalty nationwide at that time. Death sentences and executions alike have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/08/23/execution-in-texas-called-off-as-death-penalty-continues-to-dwindle-nationwide/?utm_term=.3651fc89ee97\" target=\"_blank\">plummeted nationwide in recent years</a>, while states seeking to execute inmates have struggled to obtain lethal injection drugs <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/?utm_term=.15490c62b013\" target=\"_blank\">amid an ongoing shortage</a>. Some states do have alternative methods on the books, but lethal injection remains the primary method of execution nationwide. (In a minor coincidence, opening statements on Wednesday occurred on the 34th anniversary of the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/07/us/technician-executes-murderer-in-texas-by-lethal-injection.html\" target=\"_blank\">first lethal injection</a>, which was carried out by officials in Texas.) Federal officials said last year that the government did not have any lethal injection drugs, which are increasingly difficult for officials to obtain, due to the shortage sparked, in part, by European objections to capital punishment interrupting the supply of drugs. When asked last month if the Bureau of Prisons had any drugs or planned to try to obtain any, a spokesman said the agency was \u201ccurrently in the process of revising its execution protocol.\u201d The current federal lethal injection protocol involves three drugs \u2014 an anesthetic, paralytic and a drug to stop the heart \u2014 a combination commonly used in executions across the country until <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/19/the-recent-history-of-states-scrambling-to-keep-using-lethal-injections/?utm_term=.15490c62b013\" target=\"_blank\">the drug shortage began</a>.

Questions about Roof\u2019s sentence will not end with this case.

If he is convicted and sentenced on the state charges, Roof would become the 39th person on South Carolina\u2019s death row, which last sent an inmate to the death chamber in 2011.

Now that the jury has recommended a death sentence, the judge will have to impose it, which will formally make Roof the 60th federal inmate facing death, according to the Bureau of Prisons. However, it is not clear when, or if, the federal government would be able to carry out this punishment. Federal death sentences such as Roof\u2019s are extremely rare, and executions are even less common. The 59 federal death row inmates account for a small fraction of the nearly 3,000 condemned inmates in states nationwide, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based nonprofit. Since the federal death penalty statute was reinstated in 1988 and expanded in 1994, the government has put three inmates to death, all by lethal injection. The last federal execution was more than a decade ago. Louis Jones Jr., a Gulf War veteran, convicted of the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of Tracie Joy McBride, a 19-year-old Army recruit, was put to death in 2003. Two years before that, the government executed Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing and Juan Raul Garza for murdering three men. Still, the sentence announced on Tuesday in Charleston is itself relatively rare. The government has taken a little more than 200 federal death penalty cases to trial since 1988, according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project. (Attorneys general had agreed to let prosecutors seek death sentences in more cases, but many of those ended with plea deals or the government opting not to pursue the death penalty, the project\u2019s records show.) In the federal cases that actually saw juries decide on a sentence, they opted for life imprisonment about twice as often as death sentences, the project reported. Before Roof, the most recent addition to the federal death row was Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-boston-marathon-bomber/2015/05/15/30a493b8-fb07-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html?hpid=z1\" target=\"_blank\">sentenced to death on federal charges in 2015</a> for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing.

The news came as a relief to scientists behind the two-part ExoMars mission, who are still reeling after their spacecraft Schiaparelli crashed in an attempt to land on the Red Planet during the first part of the mission. But a proposal to survey a near-Earth asteroid \u2014 and eventually attempt to knock it off course \u2014 was not so lucky. Last month, more than 100 planetary scientists, engineers and physicists had <a href=\"http://wpo.st/k-XJ2\">signed an open letter</a> in support of NASA and ESA's Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission, warning that humanity really needs to figure out whether we can deflect a killer asteroid before it crashes into Earth. But ESA Director General Jan Woerner said that the ESA part of the program didn't get enough backing or funding to ensure its future, although the space agency will continue to study asteroid defense in other ways. \u201cThese asteroid activities, looking at how we can really defend our planet in case something is happening and Bruce Willis is not ready to do it a second time .\u2009.\u2009. will be continued,\u201d he joked to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-space-idUSKBN13R1WU\">Reuters</a>, referencing the 1998 movie \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/\">Armageddon</a>,\u201d in which Willis plays a driller who must save Earth from an asteroid capable of causing a mass extinction. The decision makes it even less likely that NASA will pursue its half of the mission, which would have sent a spacecraft slamming into the asteroid as ESA satellites observed the maneuver. The funding decisions came out of a two-day meeting of government ministers in Lucerne, Switzerland. Europe approved an extra 339 million euros for the ExoMars rover, and ESA said it could cobble together an additional 97 million euros by reshuffling funds internally, according to Nature. \u201cAfter the many challenging, difficult and rewarding moments of 2016, this is a great relief and a fine result for European space exploration,\u201d Don McCoy, ESA\u2019s project manager for ExoMars, told <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/europe-s-first-mars-rover-gets-funding-despite-crash-of-test-craft-1.21091\">Nature</a>. The first half of the mission, which is a joint project of ESA and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscosmos_State_Corporation\" title=\"Roscosmos State Corporation\">Russian Federal Space Agency</a>, arrived at Mars this October. It included the Trace Gas Orbiter, which will circle above the planet sniffing for gases that could be signs of habitability or even life, and the Schiaparelli lander. The latter spacecraft was primarily designed to test the technologies needed for landing \u2014 and it failed. An <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/10/21/esa-confirms-the-exomars-lander-crashed-possibly-exploded-on-impact/?utm_term=.4990c987445e\">ESA investigation</a> revealed that the lander misinterpreted sensor data during its descent, so it thought it was below ground level rather than two miles above it. Schiaparelli jettisoned its parachute, turned off its thrusters too early and went into a free fall before coming to a crashing halt on the Martian surface. <i>[<a href=\"http://wpo.st/muc72\">The Schiaparelli crash shows how difficult it is to land on Mars</a>]</i> It was a sadly familiar scenario. Roughly half of all Mars missions fail, and ESA had already lost one lander to the deadly descent to the surface. Prospects for the rover mission, which is already over budget and delayed from its original launch date in 2018, looked uncertain after the Schiaparelli crash. \u201cCompletion of ExoMars was probably the most challenging of our discussions because of the size of the additional resources that have been put on the table,\u201d Roberto Battiston, president of the Italian Space Agency, told the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38183188\">BBC</a>. But European ministers decided to commit to the project anyway. Engineers say they learned important lessons from the crash that will help the 2020 robot land safely on the Red Planet, where it will drill beneath the surface in search of microbes that might survive beyond the reach of deadly radiation. The ESA also committed to participating in the International Space Station until at least 2024. <strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"http://wpo.st/x-w62\">Elon Musk unveils Mars colonization plan, but don't pack your bags just yet</a> <a href=\"http://wpo.st/M-w62\">NASA's Juno spacecraft may have a malfunctioning engine</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/10/17/dear-science-how-did-the-planets-get-their-names/\">Dear Science: How did the planets get their names?</a> <a href=\"http://wpo.st/Cc4F2\">That study critiquing NASA\u2019s \u2018bad science\u2019 on asteroids is pretty bad science</a> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 80910.0, "text": "Trace Gas Orbiter", "wiki_title": "enwiki:ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter", "entityid": 18323478}, {"id": 80920.0, "text": "Red Planet", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mars", "entityid": 9995267}, {"id": 80930.0, "text": "Switzerland", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Switzerland", "entityid": 26748}, {"id": 80940.0, "text": "International Space Station", "wiki_title": "enwiki:International Space Station", "entityid": 15043}, {"id": 80950.0, "text": "Italian Space Agency", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Italian Space Agency", "entityid": 716982}, {"id": 80960.0, "text": "Willis", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Bruce Willis", "entityid": 64673}, {"id": 80970.0, "text": "Earth", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Earth", "entityid": 9215}, {"id": 80980.0, "text": "Schiaparelli", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Schiaparelli EDM lander", "entityid": 48944968}, {"id": 80990.0, "text": "BBC", "wiki_title": "enwiki:BBC", "entityid": 1317868}, {"id": 80910.0, "text": "Nature", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Nature (journal)", "entityid": 43427}, {"id": 80911.0, "text": "Lucerne", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Lucerne", "entityid": 184017}, {"id": 80912.0, "text": "European", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Europe", "entityid": 9239}, {"id": 80913.0, "text": "Reuters", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Reuters", "entityid": 7502981}, {"id": 80914.0, "text": "ESA", "wiki_title": "enwiki:European Space Agency", "entityid": 10363}, {"id": 80915.0, "text": "NASA", "wiki_title": "enwiki:NASA", "entityid": 525884}, {"id": 80916.0, "text": "Russian Federal Space Agency", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Roscosmos State Corporation", "entityid": 1819207}, {"id": 80917.0, "text": "Jan Woerner", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Johann-Dietrich W%C3%B6rner", "entityid": 1819207}]}
{"docId": "9dd7b85cd1e3da1b5c8e79f32fec7177", "title": "Researchers have found a \u2018striking\u2019 new side effect from eating fast food", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "<em>This story and its headline have been been updated, with \"alarming\" being changed to \"striking.\" See below for more details.</em> Critics of the fast-food industry have long warned about the perils of our addiction to processed food. Big Macs and Whoppers might taste good, but put too many of them in your body and it will expand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4_cf_fZDc0\" target=\"_blank\">as Violet Beauregard's did</a> in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (although maybe not quite as fast). The evidence is decades in the making. The rise of processed food, after all, has coincided with an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/12/look-at-how-much-weight-weve-gained-since-the-1960s/\" target=\"_blank\">alarming growth in the size of our collective gut</a>. But there might be some new powerful ammunition for those who could do without the food the fast-food industry serves. Researchers at George Washington University have linked fast-food consumption to the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, a connection they argue could have \"great public health significance.\" Specifically, the team found that people who eat fast food tend to have significantly higher levels of certain phthalates, which are commonly used in consumer products such as soap and makeup to make them less brittle but have been linked to a number of adverse health outcomes, including <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534276\" target=\"_blank\">higher rates of infertility</a>, <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/a-threat-to-male-fertility/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">especially among males</a>. The danger, the researchers believe, isn't necessarily a result of the food itself, but rather the process by which the food is prepared. <a href=\"http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2016/4/ehp.1510803.acco.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The findings</a> were published in Environmental Health Perspectives, a journal funded by the National Institutes of Health. \"We're not trying to create paranoia or anxiety, but I do think our findings are alarming,\" said one of the study's authors, Ami Zota, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University. \"It's not every day that you conduct a study where the results are this strong.\" (Update: A few hours after publication, Zota called to say that in reading her quote she felt that the word \"alarming\" was too strong a word to use to describe her findings. Rather, she said \"striking\" was more appropriate, because it conveys the magnitude of the findings without assigning a sense of urgency.) In order to gauge how fast food affects the presence of certain non-natural chemicals, the team analyzed data for nearly 9,000 people. The data was collected as part of federal nutrition surveys conducted between 2003 and 2010. The surveys included detailed information about the participants' diets, including what each had eaten in the last 24 hours. They also contained the results of urine samples taken at the same time, which allowed the researchers to measure the levels of three separate chemicals. For the purpose of the study, any food eaten at or from restaurants without waiters or waitresses was considered fast food. Everything else \u2014 food eaten at sit-down restaurants and bars or purchased from supermarkets and vending machines \u2014 was not. The first thing the researchers found was that roughly one-third of the participants said they had eaten some form of fast food over the course of the day leading up to the urine sample collection. That proportion, high as it might seem, is actually in line with government estimates. In fact, more than a third of all children and adolescents living in the country still eat some form of fast food on any given day, a number that hasn't budged in decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The second thing the researchers found is that those participants who said they had eaten fast food in the last 24 hours tended to have much higher levels of two separate phthalates \u2014 DEHP and DiNP. People who reported eating only a little fast food had DEHP levels that were 15.5 percent higher and DiNP levels that were 25 percent higher than those who said they had eaten none. For people who reported eating a sizable amount, the increase was 24 percent and 39 percent, respectively. And the connection held true even after the researchers adjusted for various factors about the participants' habits and backgrounds that might have contributed to the association between fast-food consumption and phthalate levels. \"We looked at it in so many different ways, and the effect still remains,\" said Zota. There is little consensus on the harms of phthalates, which are widely used in commerce and give materials such as food packaging added flexibility, except that exposure to them \"<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/phthalates_factsheet.html\" target=\"_blank\">is widespread.</a>\" But there is growing concern that the chemicals could pose a variety of risks, particularly when observed in the sort of levels seen in the study. \"There's a vast amount of scientific evidence suggesting certain phthalates can contribute to several adverse health effects,\" said Zota. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796563\" target=\"_blank\">A 2012 study</a> found a strong association between the presence of DEHP and diabetes. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23429708\" target=\"_blank\">A 2013 study</a> found that exposure to the industrial chemical can increase the risk of various allergic diseases in children. And <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161813X16300365\" target=\"_blank\">a 2016 study</a> concluded that it can also negatively affect child behavior. While there is less evidence that DiNP is problematic, some recent research suggests it very well could be. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156503\" target=\"_blank\">A study undertaken last year</a>, for instance, found that exposure to the phthalate was associated with higher blood pressure. For these reasons, many governments have moved to limit exposure to the industrial chemicals. Japan <a href=\"https://www.frost.com/sublib/display-market-insight.do?id=7811388\" target=\"_blank\">disallowed the use of vinyl gloves</a> in food preparation for fear that their use was compromising health. The European Union, which <a href=\"http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/biocidal-products-regulation\" target=\"_blank\">limits the use of the chemical</a>, has been nudging manufacturers to replace it. And the United States <a href=\"http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Phthalates-Information/\" target=\"_blank\">restricted its use in toys</a>. In fact, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/pubhealth/roc/roc13/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that DEHP is \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\" The reason people who eat fast food seem to have much higher levels of potentially harmful industrial chemicals is unclear. But it's easy enough to guess: the sheer amount of processing that goes into food served at quick-service restaurants. The more machinery, plastic, conveyor belts, and various forms of processing equipment that food touches, the more likely the food is to contain higher levels of phthalates. And fast food tends to touch a good deal more of these things than, say, the food one purchases at a local farmers market. \"I really hope this study helps raise public awareness about the exposure problems associated with our industrialized food system,\" said Zota. Considering the prevalence of packaged food \u2014 and widespread exposure to phthalates (they can be detected in more than 98 percent of the population, per the CDC) \u2014 however,  the takeaway isn't necessarily that fast food is toxic. Fast food, after all, isn't the only culprit here. Nor are less healthful things in general. \"It\u2019s not fair to say, 'Oh, these exposures only happen if you eat unhealthy foods,'\" Leo Trasande, an associate professor of pediatrics, environmental medicine and population health at New York University, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-13/fast-food-eaters-have-more-industrial-chemicals-in-their-bodies\" target=\"_blank\">told Bloomberg</a>. Anything that's gone through some form of processing or industrial packaging is vulnerable. Still, given the new study's findings, it certainly seems as though eating fast food is more toxic than avoiding it, and not for the obvious reasons. Perhaps that's something many would have expected to hear, but it doesn't make it any less true. \"Traditional fast food was never meant to be daily fare, and it shouldn\u2019t be,\" said Marion Nestle, who is the Paulette Goddard professor of nutrition and food Studies at New York University. \"It\u2019s too high in calories and salt and, as we now know, the chemicals that get into our food supply through industrial food production.\" <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/postwellness/\">Like our Health & Wellness page on Facebook</a> for more science news about the ins and outs of the human body and mind, essays and advice.

So, while Greenberg drove down the highway, Miller and Valasek sat on Miller\u2019s couch 10 miles away and played God. \u201cThough I hadn\u2019t touched the dashboard, the vents in the Jeep Cherokee started blasting cold air at the maximum setting, chilling the sweat on my back through the in-seat climate control system,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">Greenberg wrote</a>. \u201cNext the radio switched to the local hip hop station and began blaring Skee-lo at full volume. I spun the control knob left and hit the power button, to no avail. Then the windshield wipers turned on, and wiper fluid blurred the glass. \u201cAs I tried to cope with all this, a picture of the two hackers performing these stunts appeared on the car\u2019s digital display: Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, wearing their trademark track suits.

I need to move,\u201d Greenberg said, pleading for the hackers to return power to the vehicle. Greenberg survived to tell his tale, of course, but the ordeal is just the latest in a series of incidents highlighting the startling security vulnerabilities of hundreds of thousands of American automobiles. These incidents have raised the specter of remote-controlled car accidents, in which anarchist hackers or computer-savvy assassins could still be at home in their pajamas while wreaking havoc. On Tuesday, just hours after Wired published its story, Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) unveiled a bill aimed at keeping Internet-connected cars from getting hacked. \u201cRushing to roll out the next big thing, automakers have left cars unlocked to hackers and data-trackers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/07/21/the-push-to-regulate-driverless-cars-has-finally-begun/\">Blumenthal said</a>. \u201cControlled demonstrations show how frightening it would be to have a hacker take over controls of a car,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">Markey said in a statement to Wired</a>. \u201cDrivers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between being connected and being protected\u2026We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers.\u201d [<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/next-dashboard-warning-may-be-your-car-has-been-hacked/2015/07/21/ef26e9f4-2fbd-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html\"><i>Next dashboard warning may be, \u2018Your car has been hacked!\u2019</i></a>] Even the hackers themselves were taken aback by their abilities. \u201cWhen I saw we could do it anywhere, over the Internet, I freaked out,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">Valasek told Wired</a>. \u201cI was frightened. It was like, holy f\u2014, that\u2019s a vehicle on a highway in the middle of the country. Car hacking got real, right then.\u201d   The problem is one of our own creation. Like thousands of other everyday devices, from coffeemakers to power plants, cars are increasingly connected to the Internet. This enables drivers to stream music, watch videos and use GPS. But it also exposes their cars \u2014 and therefore the drivers as well \u2014 to hackers. Miller and Valasek exploited a weak spot in Uconnect, an Internet-connected feature on as many as 471,000 Fiat Chrysler late-model automobiles, most of them in the United States. Using a laptop computer and a burner phone, they were able to send a series of commands to the car. \u201cUconnect computers are linked to the Internet by Sprint\u2019s cellular network, and only other Sprint devices can talk to them,\u201d Greenberg explained. By connecting a phone to his laptop, Miller was able to use the phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot and search Sprint\u2019s entire 3G network for hack-able cars. [<em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/06/22/net-of-insecurity-part-3/\">Hackers warned senators of the Internet\u2019s vulnerabilities back in 1998, but were ignored</a></em>] Not only does the computer weakness allow hackers to manipulate the locks and turn off the engine, it also enables them to cut the brakes. They can even take over the steering wheel if the car is in reverse. \u201cFrom an attacker\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a super nice vulnerability,\u201d Miller <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">told Greenberg</a>. The stunt seems to confirm fears that have worried security experts for several years now. In 2011, researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California at San Diego <a href=\"http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf\">proved they could remotely disable a car\u2019s locks and brakes</a>. While the researchers didn\u2019t reveal the car manufacturer, Miller and Valasek have made no secret that their hack affects cars made by Fiat Chrysler. Before going public with the news, however, the hackers took their findings to the company. Chrysler has recently released a patch to prevent such hacking. \u201c[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] has a program in place to continuously test vehicles systems to identify vulnerabilities and develop solutions,\u201d the company said in a statement <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">sent to WIRED</a>. \u201cFCA is committed to providing customers with the latest software updates to secure vehicles against any potential vulnerability.\u201d \u201cPatch your Chrysler vehicle before hackers kill you,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/07/21/patch-your-chrysler-vehicle-before-hackers-kill/\">warned Fox News</a> on Wednesday after Wired published its article. Thanks to Miller and Valasek, Chrysler drivers can now guard against such invasions. But the Uconnect weakness is only the tip of an Internet security iceberg. There are many other ways that a car can be compromised by hackers. Other brands, for example, might not be any safer. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are qualitative differences in security between vehicles today,\u201d UCSD computer science professor Stefan Savage <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">told Wired</a>. \u201cThe Europeans are a little bit ahead. The Japanese are a little bit behind.

{"docId": "dcd1560bd13a0b665b95d3ba27cc960c", "title": "After years of alleged bullying, an Ohio teen killed herself. Is her school district responsible?", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "Growing up, Emilie Olsen had an infectious smile, a love for horses and a perfect attendance record. She was a straight-A student and an excellent volleyball player. Emilie \u201chad an extremely sweet spirit about her,\u201d a family friend <a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/father-claims-daughters-death-result-of-bullying/njSty/\">recalled</a>. On Dec. 11, 2014, the 13-year-old shot and killed herself at home. It was a tragedy that sent a jolt through Fairfield, Ohio, where Emilie had lived since her parents, Marc and Cindy Olsen, adopted her from China when she was 9 months old. Classmates and neighbors mourned a young life cut short. But in the days following Emilie\u2019s death, her parents spoke out against the seeming suddenness of it all. Emilie\u2019s death was precipitated by cruel, relentless bullying, the Olsens said. Worse: It could have been prevented, they claimed, if officials at Fairfield Intermediate and Middle School had been more responsive. Emilie did not have to die, they said. These were the allegations made in an <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2646255/Fairfield-Wrongful-Death-Lawsuit.pdf\">82-page federal lawsuit</a> the Olsens filed against Fairfield City School District, various administrators and Emilie\u2019s alleged bullies last December. Since then, their fight to hold the school district accountable for their daughter\u2019s death has been met with support from parents and denials from school officials. Former Fairfield City Schools superintendent Paul Otten, who is among the defendants named in the complaint, <a href=\"http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/fairfield/fairfield-city-schools-superintendent-paul-otten-to-take-reins-of-beavercreek-city-schools\">left his position</a> last month to become the superintendent of the nearby Beavercreek City School District. Just last week, Fairfield Middle School Principal Lincoln Butts, also a defendant, <a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/local/fairfield-principal-accused-in-emilie-olsen-lawsui/nrPdY/\">resigned</a> for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d Neither administrator gave specific explanations for leaving. In response to the lawsuit\u2019s December filing, the school district said in a statement, according to <a href=\"http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/fairfield/fairfield-city-schools-superintendent-paul-otten-to-take-reins-of-beavercreek-city-schools\">WCPO</a>: \u201cThe District will be defending the litigation and will be providing appropriate responses in the course of the litigation. The District has no further comment at this time regarding this pending matter.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit alleges that Emilie suffered discrimination because of her race and perceived sexual orientation and that school officials were negligent in their handling of her bullying. The complaint details a downward spiral brought on by unabating abuse. <strong>Escalating incidents</strong> It started in the fifth grade, according to the complaint, when Emilie took to wearing camouflage-patterned clothing and cowboy boots. Her style allegedly prompted jeers from classmates, who called her \u201cfake country\u201d \u2014 because \u201cChinese people don\u2019t wear camo.\u201d Things got worse when Emilie entered the sixth grade, the complaint said. She allegedly became the target of mean-spirited social media messages, as well as a fake Instagram account called \u201cEmilie Olsen is Gay.\u201d One classmate allegedly followed Emilie into the bathroom, handed her a razor and instructed her to \u201cend her life.\u201d Other Instagram accounts surfaced, making sexually explicit comments and derogatory remarks about Emilie\u2019s perceived sexual orientation. In the gym one day, Emilie and another female student got into a scuffle over the fake accounts, and the student allegedly pushed Emilie and slapped her in the face. A teacher allegedly witnessed and broke up the fight but took no action other than to direct the students \u201cback to class.\u201d \u201cI have a bad feeling that if nothing is done then this has the possibility to escalate into something worse,\u201d Marc Olsen wrote in an email to the school\u2019s assistant principals after learning of the fight from the father of a student who saw it happen. He then received a phone call from one of the principals, who allegedly said they were \u201cgoing to take care of the situation.\u201d According to the lawsuit, no students were ultimately disciplined for the fight or the Instagram accounts. Otten, the former superintendent, told <a href=\"http://www.wcpo.com/longform/emilie-olsen-uncovered-evidence-shows-bullying-was-factor-in-13-year-old-suicide\">WCPO</a> last May that he didn\u2019t know about the online bullying. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming that when we get something (from parents) we start researching kids\u2019 Instagram accounts and printing stuff off,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u201d Otten added that he has four kids enrolled in the school district. \u201cI can assure you,\u201d he told WCPO, \u201c\u2026 there is nothing for me to gain by hiding anything.\u201d The bullying only intensified in seventh grade, the complaint said, when Emilie was placed in the same learning group as several girls who had allegedly harassed her the year before. By then, Emilie had started to inflict self-harm and express suicidal and depressive thoughts. When the Olsens brought these circumstances to the principals\u2019 attention, they were allegedly told that Emilie \u201cneeded to buckle down\u201d and cope even though she told an administrator she was \u201cfrightened to return to school.\u201d While the cyber-bullying continued, physical messages allegedly started to appear on the stalls and walls of the school\u2019s bathrooms. These scrawled scripts singled Emilie out by name \u2014 \u201cGo kill yourself Emilie\u201d \u2014 and made reference to Emilie\u2019s race and perceived sexual orientation. According to the complaint, while the messages were in \u201ceasily observable\u201d locations and \u201ccould not have been missed by anyone using the restrooms, including the school administrators\u201d and teachers, the staff failed to remove them in a timely manner. In October 2014, a group of Emilie\u2019s friends defended her against her bullies in the cafeteria, initiating a verbal dispute as her friends yelled at the bullies to stop \u201cmessing\u201d with Emilie. (The <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2081567/school-incident-reports-10-21-14.pdf\">students\u2019 incident reports</a> were obtained by WCPO.) At a previously scheduled meeting with the assistant principals the next day, Olsen was not told about the fight involving his daughter, the complaint alleges. In the following days, Emilie started vomiting and feeling unwell. When Olsen informed the school that she would be absent because she was feeling sick, he was allegedly still not told about the fight. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through all of this, Emilie was becoming increasingly withdrawn, barely recognizable from her old self, the complaint says. She seemed to take little interest in her schoolwork, and her grades dropped dramatically. On a personality quiz that Emilie was required to take for class, she described her \u201cbad day symptoms\u201d as \u201ccrying, depressing, yelling and screaming, passive resistance, and going into a trance,\u201d the complaint says.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her Internet search history showed attempts to get help, followed by growing despair, her parents say in their lawsuit.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emilie asked strangers online whether they had ever been bullied and viewed articles about celebrities who were bullied in school. She visited a website with the line \u201cI\u2019m just a kid and my life is a nightmare,\u201d and a picture of a young woman\u2019s slashed forearm, with the caption \u201cI\u2019m not strong anymore.\u201d</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a school where Asian Americans were allegedly labeled \u201ctoo smart\u201d and mocked for their \u201cslanted eyes,\u201d Emilie seemed to feel alienated, the complaint says.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She sought permission to dye her hair to \u201clook more like a white person.\u201d Her parents allege that she asked her father, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be white like you and mom?\u201d</span> Marc Olsen later told police that Emilie had been suffering from depression and had a history of cutting herself, the Butler County Journal-News <a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/police-reports-shed-more-light-on-fairfield-teens-/njWtX/\">reported</a>. <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI[\u2018m] causing all this trouble on earth,\u201d Emilie wrote to a friend on Facebook on Dec. 1, 2014, the complaint says. </span>\u201cIt hurts when you have to explain yourself to people you don\u2019t know or like. You feel them judging you, staring at you, talking about you, and I\u2019ve made up my mind, I wanna die.\u201d</span> She went on: \u201cEven if there [sic] adults they hate me. I can\u2019t please anyone with anything I do. Not even my teachers.\u201d Less than two weeks later, Emilie killed herself with her father\u2019s gun. <strong>A school\u2019s role</strong> Five days after the suicide, the Olsens were in the throes of grief when they allegedly received a visit from Principal Butts and a group of police officers. According to the lawsuit, the officers coerced the Olsens to let them inside their home, then told Marc Olsen that he was \u201cstirring the pot\u201d and \u201centertaining rumors\u201d by talking to the media about Emilie\u2019s death. At that point, Olsen had already told the <a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/father-claims-daughters-death-result-of-bullying/njSty/\">Journal-News</a> that he thought bullying killed Emilie. Later that month, Otten sent a <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2081568/otten-letter-to-community-12-19-14.pdf\">letter to parents</a> across the district addressing \u201cthe many rumors and false reports which have surfaced\u201d about Emilie\u2019s passing. \u201cThe Fairfield Township Police Department conducted a thorough investigation and did not find any credible evidence that bullying was a factor in this tragedy,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIt seems there is an unjustified need to place blame for this horrendous event. I want you to know we all mourn the loss of Emilie. \u2026 However, the rumors and misinformation regarding this event which are being conveyed by social and other media are negatively affecting our community, our schools and our staff.\u201d A police report obtained by the <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/education/2015/12/14/emilie-olsens-family-sues-fairfield-schools-over-bullying-claims/77284500/\">Cincinnati Enquirer</a> showed that authorities spoke to Emilie\u2019s boyfriend and best friend after her death. Neither mentioned bullying. School officials have acknowledged communication with the Olsens about the bullying but said the issues were resolved \u201cto the complete satisfaction of the family.\u201d A jury trial for the suit is slated to take place in 2018. Under Ohio law, bullying and cyberbullying are prohibited in schools. But families seeking redress face an uphill battle, the Journal-News <a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/crime-law/expert-schools-often-prevail-in-bullying-lawsuits/npk93/\">reported</a>, because they must prove that schools were aware of and deliberately indifferent to threats of harm. \u201cMaybe most importantly, did the school district know about [the bullying] and did they, as the plaintiffs allege here, literally put her back into classes with the bullies that they\u2019d reported about?\u201d said <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/ohio-parents-allege-school-bullying-suit-teens-suicide/story?id=35793899\">ABC News</a> legal analyst Dan Abrams. \u201cNow the superintendent actually wrote a letter to the school community saying that he didn\u2019t think bullying had to do with this, so there\u2019s going to be clear factual disputes.\u201d A response filed by the defendants in April argues that the lawsuit\u2019s claims are invalid because school officials are not liable for violations of the anti-bullying statute. It further alleges that the school district (as opposed to the school board, which is also named) is not a valid party to the lawsuit because it is \u201cmerely a geographical area.\u201d The Olsens\u2019 lawsuit cites other alleged incidents of bullying at Fairfield City Schools, noting that their daughter\u2019s case \u201cwas not an outlier.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m speaking up for [Emilie] because she can\u2019t do that now,\u201d Marc Olsen told the <a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/father-claims-daughters-death-result-of-bullying/njSty/\">Journal-News</a> shortly after her death. \u201cShe\u2019s over in a funeral home in downtown Hamilton.

But milder strains of marijuana, even when used heavily, don't appear to carry any increased risk of psychosis. Those are the headline findings of <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(14)00117-5/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">an important new study</a> published in the journal <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> yesterday. Researchers obtained data from 410 South London patients sent to the hospital for a first-episode psychotic incident (meaning they hadn't been previously diagnosed with disorder), and compared it to data from 370 control individuals living in the same area. Compared with someone who had never smoked, a weekly user of high-potency weed (defined here as having greater than 15 percent THC content) was about three times as likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. For daily users, the risk increased to five times. On the other hand, the researchers found no link between frequent use of low-potency weed (< 5 percent THC content) and psychotic disorder. In studies like this one, it's important to remember that correlation doesn't indicate causation. \"The authors clearly point out that they cannot be sure the association seen in their study is causal,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2015/feb/16/does-smoking-skunk-cause-psychosis-but-milder-cannabis-doesnt\" target=\"_blank\">writes Suzi Gage</a>, a University of Bristol researcher who studies the link between marijuana use and psychosis, in <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper. \"The people who choose to smoke cannabis might be different in a variety of other ways, which could be the cause of the increase in psychosis risk. Although you can control for these in analyses, you can never be sure you\u2019ve adequately adjusted for them.\" Still, the different findings for smokers of low- and high-potency weed are significant, and worth digging into -- especially considering that most of the marijuana consumed in the U.S. today is of the high-octane variety. As the chart shows, the average strength of weed seized by federal authorities has steadily risen over time. Retail outlets in Denver and elsewhere advertise <a href=\"http://visit3d.com/locations/denver/\" target=\"_blank\">strains that contain 25 percent THC or more</a>. As legalization opponents are forever fond of saying, this isn't your daddy's weed. Just as you'd expect a daily pint of vodka to take a greater toll on your health than a daily pint of beer, it seems reasonable to posit that frequent use of high-octane weed will have different health consequences than a daily toke of the milder stuff. But due at least partially to the economic incentives imposed by cannabis prohibition, low-potency weed is <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/03/marijuana_potency_returning_smokers_want_mellower_pot_strains.2.html\" target=\"_blank\">typically harder to come by</a> these days. Today's illicit weed has a lot in common with prohibition-era moonshine. To maximize profits while avoiding detection, many of today's pot growers maintain a singular focus on <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-208-potent-pot-s-preeminence-befriending-racists-sean-michaels-love-of-theremin-and-more-1.2905476/potent-pot-how-marijuana-got-so-strong-and-what-it-means-for-legalization-1.2905483\" target=\"_blank\">boosting THC content</a> to the exclusion of all other considerations. The weed they produce is generally good for getting you very high, but little else. The absence of a regulatory framework -- particularly labeling requirements that let you know what you're smoking -- means that buying weed on the black market today is akin to buying a bottle of booze without knowing whether it contains beer or vodka. And chemically speaking, marijuana is a more complicated substance than alcohol. The high of a given strain of bud is determined not just by THC, but by the interaction of dozens of chemical compounds in the plant that researchers are only just now beginning to understand. One of those compounds, cannabidiol or CBD, is actually known to have <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v2/n3/full/tp201215a.html\" target=\"_blank\">anti-psychotic</a> effects, and it <a href=\"http://jop.sagepub.com/content/27/1/19\" target=\"_blank\">eases the paranoia</a> that sometimes comes with getting really, really high. CBD and THC are present in roughly equal quantities in low-potency weed, but in the high-octane stuff CBD is essentially non-existent. This is likely one reason why the <em>Lancet</em> study found higher odds of psychosis among users who liked their weed strong. As prohibition eases and legal markets open up, growers now have the breathing room to select for traits <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/whats-the-deal-with-these-high-cbd-strains\" target=\"_blank\">beyond high THC content</a>. Demand from new users looking to experience a social high, rather than <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=couchlock\" target=\"_blank\">four hours of couch lock</a>, will likely drive this. The end result may be a resurgence of milder strains of weed that are more akin to fine wines than to bathtub gin. From a mental health standpoint, they'll be safer too.

The date was even marked on her calendar, but she was panicking at the prospect. Then she spotted rumors online that China was about to abandon its one-child policy after 35 years. It was, she says, \u201clike a lifesaving straw.\u201d For days, she sat nervously at home watching television, waiting for news. \u201cWhen I heard the announcement about the new two-child policy, I cried,\u201d she said. \u201cMy daughter came in and asked why I was crying, and I told her she was about to have a sister or a brother. She hugged me and cried with me.\u201d Faced with looming workforce shortages and a rapidly aging population, China announced last month that all couples would be allowed to have two children. The one-child policy had extraordinarily far-reaching effects on Chinese society, and its relaxation marks a historic shift. The government says 90 million women, half of them in their 40s, will be affected by the change, once the National People\u2019s Congress approves a new law next year. But it has left many women agonizing about choices they made and the choices ahead of them. This woman asked not to be identified by name because her story could still land her in trouble at work. A former supervisor had warned her not to become pregnant shortly after hiring her, but she had gone ahead and had a child anyway. Her current boss, she says, is more tolerant, but state-run companies have strict rules requiring them to fire employees who have a second child. Even in private companies, many women in China face workplace pressure not to get pregnant, according to women\u2019s rights activists, creating potential tensions and tough decisions if they now decide they want a second child. \u201cThe difficulty for women in employment will increase, and gender discrimination probably will be worse,\u201d Wang Pei\u2019an, a spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that the problem could be addressed through a \u201cjoint effort.\u201d The stigma around larger families has been so strong that the 39-year-old woman said she had never even told her college classmates that she had a younger brother. Gradually, though, after her daughter was born, she began to envy couples who had two children. Her daughter, too, grew lonely and wanted a sibling. But the couple decided that they could not disobey the law. The woman began suspecting that she was pregnant shortly after taking a holiday trip with her husband in southern China last month. Finally, her husband bought her a pregnancy test. She didn\u2019t even want to look at the result. \u201cI was scared to face it, because I didn\u2019t want to make a choice between my child and my job,\u201d she said. When it was positive, she said, \u201cit was horrible news, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.\u201d And so began the agony of making a decision. She had grown up in a rural part of China, where boys were considered more important and girls usually quit their studies after high school. But she had worked hard, gone to college and secured a job she enjoyed at a state-owned company. She was proud, she said, to be an \u201ceconomically independent woman.\u201d Her husband suggested that she quit her job, offering to help her find another after the baby was born. But she was worried that he could also lose his job if his employer found out. Besides, she was in line for a promotion and knew it would be hard to find work after a break. An abortion seemed like her only option. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give it all up for an unborn baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a housewife for the rest of my life.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/horrors-of-one-child-policy-leave-deep-scars-in-chinese-society/2015/10/30/6bd28e0c-7e7b-11e5-bfb6-65300a5ff562_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a> Gao Yushuang, another 39-year-old mother, has an 8-year-old girl. She had always wanted a second child, an urge so intense that she was ready to break the law. But eventually she decided that her family could not afford a fine of $15,000 to $30,000, on top of the cost of raising a second child. She decided to stick with one. When she heard on television that the policy was changing, her mother was on the phone even before the anchor had finished speaking. \u201cShe asked: \u2018What are you waiting for? The policy has changed. You should respond to your country\u2019s call.\u2019\u2009\u201d But Gao was not so sure. For her, she said, it felt like the chance had passed. \u201cIf it had happened five years before, everything would have been different,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have been more energetic. My parents and in-laws would have been healthier, too. I definitely would have wanted a baby.\u201d Internet searches for pregnancy-related products surged on China\u2019s online shopping platforms after the news broke last week, <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015cpcplenarysession/2015-11/07/content_22394246.htm\" target=\"_blank\">state media reported.</a> Demographer Lu Jiehua of Peking University warned that many of the women rushing to take advantage of the policy shift would be those born in the 1970s, potentially involving greater health risks for mothers and babies. For Gao, the balance had shifted. Her parents could become sick at any time, and she thought she lacked the energy to look after and educate another young child, she said. Then there was the stigma of being an older mother, and a fear that she would spoil the child. Gao said she didn\u2019t go into all of this with her mother. To avoid an argument, she simply said she was too old to have another baby. The following day, she said, her phone was full of information about the change in government policy. \u201cIt was more stressful than ever,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was talking about having a second child. It felt like a time bomb. I felt I had betrayed my mother\u2019s wishes. I was scared I might regret it one day.\u201d So Gao sat down and wrote her future self a journal titled \u201cWhy I don\u2019t want a second child.\u201d \u201cIf one day my only child leaves me, and I am all alone, I will read the journal, and I will understand why I didn\u2019t have a second child, and it will stop me suffering from regret,\u201d she said. \u201cMy tears fell when I was writing.

Three years later, the pressure has only mounted: She and her husband spend more than $10,000 a year on after-school classes. It\u2019s a huge drain on their time, and an even bigger one on their resources, given that her husband earns less than $35,000 a year.  Their apartment is too small for a second child, and the cost of moving to a bigger one in Beijing has risen out of their reach. But it is not just money that is preventing them from having a second one: Han says they have also devoted all of their time and energy into their son, and they are simply exhausted. \u201cSeeing how much pressure my kid is under makes us feel bad, too, so I don\u2019t want another kid of mine to go through this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s so tired. We\u2019re too tired. Whether it\u2019s us or the child, I don\u2019t think of any of us can handle another one.\u201d For nearly seven decades, China\u2019s Communist Party has been an invisible presence in every bedroom here. In 1949, Mao Zedong said having more people would make the country stronger. The party condemned birth control and outlawed the import of contraceptives. Millions of women followed the Great Helmsman\u2019s advice, and the population doubled. It wasn\u2019t until after Mao died that the party reversed course, doing so dramatically and often brutally. The one-child policy introduced in 1979 led to untold millions of forced abortions, sterilizations and horrific abuses of power. Birthrates plummeted. Now, the party is changing course again. China\u2019s population is aging fast, and that\u2019s a huge, looming burden on the economy. The one-child policy was relaxed in 2013 and abandoned at the beginning of this year. The party wants people to get busy again. Provinces all across China have offered women longer maternity leave, often adding several months to the old standard 98 days. In villages, new slogans are being dreamed up by party committees and draped across buildings and walls. \u201cTrain your body, build up strength, get ready for the second baby!\u201d one slogan said, according to reports in an online forum. \u201cGet to sleep early, stop playing cards, work hard to produce a child!\u201d exhorted another. \u201cNo fines, no arrests. Go ahead and have a second child if you want one!\u201d The problem is that many people don\u2019t want a second child any more. Having only one has become ingrained in Chinese culture and society, and people no longer believe the party should be telling them what to do in the bedroom.  So when officials in the city of Yichang in Hubei province issued a public letter in September exhorting party members to \u201crespond to the party\u2019s call\u201d and \u201cfully implement the two-child policy,\u201d there was outrage online. \u201cYou can\u2019t just make people have kids when you want them to, or stop when you tell them, we are humans not pigs!\u201d one person posted. Even the state-owned <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1009190.shtml\">Global Times</a> newspaper called the recommendations \u201cridiculous and illegal,\u201d and the public letter has since disappeared from the website of the city\u2019s health and family planning commission. The government says the national birthrate rose by 6.9 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, with 800,000 more births recorded.  State media even reported a <a href=\"http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-08/30/content_26639808.htm\" target=\"_self\">\u201cbaby boom\u201d</a> in Beijing, with long lines forming at the capital\u2019s top hospitals to reserve beds, and some maternity wards booked until next April.  But those reports were misleading, said Wang Feng, of the University of California at Irvine. This year\u2019s rise in childbirths is below the government\u2019s target of 2.5 million extra births in 2016, he said, and still modest considering all the pent-up demand that the one-child policy should have created.  The lines at the capital\u2019s top hospitals are a function of bottlenecks in China\u2019s overstretched health system: Many of the women who have elected to give birth this year are older than average, and have been encouraged to head for Grade A hospitals in case of complications. Indeed, when the one-child policy was first relaxed in 2013, allowing parents who grew up as only children to have a second child, just 18 percent of the 11 million eligible couples applied to do so, Wang said, a response he called \u201clukewarm.\u201d  Mass migration to cities, where costs of living are high, has depressed birthrates, while people are getting married later, or not at all, Wang said. \u201cIn the short run, hopefully China can add more people to its population, but in the long run it is very unlikely that fertility will go above 1.5 children per couple,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/racing-towards-the-precipice/\" target=\"_self\">problem for China</a>. The people born in Mao\u2019s era are growing old, and there will be far fewer people of working age to bear the economic burden.  But Xi Wei, father of a 9-year-old boy, said that he and his wife won\u2019t be trying for another child. Their son does extra classes after school and all day on Saturday, and parents and child all feel exhausted by the social pressure for him not to \u201cfall behind.\u201d As only children themselves, Xi and his wife also don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with growing up alone. \u201cAfter all these years, everybody is inclined to just have one child. Everybody\u2019s used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you have a second child when the whole society has hostile and incompatible resources towards it?\u201d <strong></strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/horrors-of-one-child-policy-leave-deep-scars-in-chinese-society/2015/10/30/6bd28e0c-7e7b-11e5-bfb6-65300a5ff562_story.html\" target=\"_self\">Horrors of one-child policy leave deep scars in Chinese society</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/as-china-drops-one-child-rule-joy-for-some-agonizing-choices-for-others/2015/11/10/e1336b8f-b0c2-4610-9a3c-ec85a546c9ad_story.html\" target=\"_self\">For many moms, the end of China\u2019s one-child rule came too late</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-lifts-one-child-policy-amid-worries-of-graying-population/2015/10/29/207fc0e6-7e2b-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html\" target=\"_self\">China lifts one-child policy amid worries over graying population</a> "}], "saliency": []}

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, says Rezaian was targeted for arrest to gain advantage in a prisoner exchange and to \u201cextort\u201d concessions from the U.S. government in the multinational talks over lifting sanctions if Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program. Iranian officials repeatedly told Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who also was <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/jason_rezaian_washington_post.php\" shape=\"rect\">detained</a> <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-detaining-jason-rezaian\" shape=\"rect\"></a> for more than two months, that Rezaian had \u201cvalue\u201d as a bargaining chip for a prisoner swap, the suit says.

Rezaian; his brother, Ali Rezaian; and their mother, Mary Rezaian, are asking for an unspecified sum for damages under the \u201cterrorism exception\u201d to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That law generally bars U.S. citizens from suing foreign governments in domestic courts, but exceptions are made for terrorist acts, torture or hostage-taking by countries, including Iran, that the State Department has designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The suit accuses Iran of all three. Rezaian and Salehi, who was born in Iran and married Rezaian there, were arrested on July 22, 2014, by Iranian agents wearing surgical masks who forced their way into the couple\u2019s apartment and took them for questioning at Evin prison, a notorious site for political prisoners. Salehi was freed 71 days later on a $32,000 bail provided by her brother-in-law, Ali. Rezaian was eventually tried and convicted on espionage and related charges, according to Iranian state media accounts. But the Iranian government has never officially disclosed the specifics of his conviction in a closed-door trial or the sentence imposed by a judge known for meting out harsh punishments. The lawsuit provides details of Rezaian\u2019s incarceration that had never before been publicly revealed. Both Rezaian and Salehi were repeatedly subjected to psychological and physical abuse during lengthy interrogations, the suit says. Their captors at turns threatened to dismember or execute them. Interrogated in isolation and often deprived of sleep, each also was warned that the other might be maimed or executed, and that the same fate could befall other family members in Iran, according to the filing. The ordeal was so intense that Rezaian, Salehi and Rezaian\u2019s brother, Ali, all contemplated suicide, the suit says. Now \u2014 almost nine months after Rezaian and four other U.S. citizens were released on the day the nuclear deal was implemented \u2014 Salehi, the Rezaian brothers and their mother are still afflicted with trauma and guilt, according to the suit. \u201cFor 544 days, Jason suffered such physical mistreatment and severe psychological abuse in Evin Prison that he will never be the same,\u201d the suit states. \u201cHe will require specialized medical and other treatment for the rest of his life.\u201d Salehi is not a plaintiff in the suit. Nor is The Washington Post. Rezaian is on leave from The Post for a year as a Nieman fellow at Harvard University. \u201cIran\u2019s unconscionable actions have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on The Washington Post\u2019s Jason Rezaian and his family,\u201d said Executive Editor Martin Baron, who during the reporter\u2019s imprisonment often criticized what he called Iran\u2019s \u201csystem of injustice.\u201d \u201cThis legal filing is a stark telling of Iran\u2019s brutal and heartless treatment of an innocent journalist and his wife, and the impact on those who love him. While this legal action is being taken solely by Jason and his family, The Post continues to support the Rezaians through their long and painful recovery.\u2019\u2019 The Rezaian lawsuit is the latest attempt by Americans to have the U.S. justice system provide compensation for harms inflicted by the Iranian government \u2014 in particular, by the powerful and hard-line <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/iran-detaining-jason-rezaian\" shape=\"rect\">Revolutionary Guard Corps</a>, which fiercely opposed the nuclear deal and has tried to thwart many initiatives of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative pragmatist. The corps is named as a co-defendant in the suit. \u201cThis was really one of the few ways they felt they could try to hold Iran publicly accountable,\u201d said David Bowker, Rezaian\u2019s attorney. \u201cIdeally, it will deter this kind of behavior toward other innocent people.\u201d Rezaian and his family declined to discuss the case, referring questions to their lawyer. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not reply to an email requesting comment. In a number of suits brought against it over the years, Iran has not responded, resulting in default judgments. Congress and U.S. courts have provided a legal framework for Americans to sue Iran and be compensated. The State Department has labeled Iran the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Sudan and Syria are also on the list. In April, the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-allows-families-of-terrorism-victims-to-college-iranian-assets/2016/04/20/6793f0cc-0703-11e6-a12f-ea5aed7958dc_story.html\" shape=\"rect\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">upheld a law</a> allowing American victims of terrorism and their families to collect almost $2 billion in seized Iranian assets. The case involved relatives of people killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. Iran labeled the decision \u201cconfiscation\u201d and \u201ctheft.\u201d The closest precedent to Rezaian\u2019s case involves Nik Moradi, an Iranian American who was seized during a family visit in 2007 and accused of spying for the United States. More than six months before his release on bail, he said, he was subjected to physical and mental torture during interrogations. In 2013, Moradi and his wife sued Iran in U.S. federal court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The couple was awarded $20 million in a default judgment after Iran failed to respond. One possible venue for securing payment on a judgment is the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, created last year by Congress to compensate the Americans held hostage in Iran during the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran after the 1979 revolution. It also set aside money for victims with court judgments against state sponsors of terrorism, funded by money from a civil penalty paid by BNP Paribas bank for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan. The lawsuit provides dark glimpses of Rezaian\u2019s 50 days in solitary confinement in a small, dank, cockroach-infested cell. Anxiety and depression made him hallucinate, as he perceived the walls moving and talking. The cell was constantly lighted, and a noisy fan hindered his sleep. Rezaian slept on the floor, and prison officials eventually gave him tranquilizers to induce sleep. His food sometimes had concrete, rocks, dirt and other inedible objects mixed in. \u201cDuring his time in solitary confinement, Jason believed he was losing his mind,\u201d the suit says. In the initial months of his imprisonment, Rezaian was taken blindfolded several times a day to an underground room for interrogations that lasted hours. He was forced to write down his answers, which prison officials translated into Farsi before trying to coerce him to sign without explaining the translations. In an effort to get Rezaian to confess to espionage, the suit says, one interrogator threatened him with beheading. Another held out the carrot of a video confession as his only chance for freedom. \u201cThey threatened Jason with physical mutilation, such as cutting off his limbs, and repeatedly told Jason that he would never see Yeganeh alive again,\u201d the suit says. Though Salehi is not a plaintiff, her agony is clear in the suit\u2019s dry legalese. During her detention, Salehi was blindfolded as interrogators hit the table, broke glass and kicked her chair, startling her. One interrogator threatened to cut off her left leg and right hand or arm. They told her they would throw her husband off a cliff if she did not incriminate him. <span>By the time she was released, her legs would go numb and she sometimes fainted when sitting down. She had to shear off her hair because it was so matted. She had skin lesions. On her infrequent visits to the prison to see her husband, she sometimes was made to don a prison uniform and told she might be detained again, the suit says. </span>Convinced that her husband would die in Evin prison, she considered killing herself to draw attention to his plight. Ali Rezaian, who quit his job to work full time campaigning for his brother\u2019s release, also grew despondent, according to the suit. <span>Iranian agents tailed him when he went to Geneva to appeal for help from the U.N. Human Rights Council, and his mother was held against her will in Iran.</span> \u201cHe contemplated suicide in the fall of 2015, having lost faith that his brother would ever be released,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAt the time, Ali believed that only by ending his own life could he prompt action by defendants or others, to free Jason.\u201d Jason Rezaian now experiences depression, sleeplessness, short-term memory loss and other symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, the suit says. He grows anxious in large crowds, fears for his family\u2019s safety and has grown more \u201cdetached\u201d from them. He sees a psychologist. \u201cPlaintiffs live in constant fear that Iranian agents are spying on them, plotting additional acts of terrorism and planning ways to hurt them and their family members again,\u201d the suit says.

Drink a beer with \u2018the deplorables\u2019 in Boehner\u2019s old district.", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "<em>With Breanne Deppisch</em> <strong>THE BIG IDEA:</strong> <strong>MIDDLETOWN, Ohio\u2014Many Washington elites, including Republicans, do not know a single person who supports Donald Trump. In this depressed industrial town in southwestern Ohio, it is hard to find anyone who says they are for Hillary Clinton.</strong> \u201cI cannot tell you one person I know of who has said to me that they support Hillary. Not one,\u201d said Chris Polleys, who cleans benzene pots at the AK Steel plant here. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s doing anything in the polls. I see Hillary for prison, but there\u2019s no Hillary for president signs anywhere. It\u2019s just impossible for me to believe that they\u2019re neck and neck.\u201d A <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/images/polling/ps/ps10032016_S27kmrd.pdf\">poll</a> published yesterday by Quinnipiac University shows that <strong>Trump is ahead of Clinton in Ohio by 5 points</strong> (47 percent to 42 percent) and that this is the only battleground state where his lead expanded in the wake of the first debate. The GOP nominee\u2019s strength can be explained, in part, by his extraordinary popularity with white men who did not go to college in places like this, where Democrats were once strong but which have moved sharply toward Republicans during the presidency of Barack Obama. Polleys, 40, was smoking Marlboros and drinking $1 Bud Lights with his brother, Dale Baxter, at a bar along the railroad tracks on the edge of town. Baxter, a machinist, said he met a handful of people in Dayton who support Clinton. But he agrees: Trump will win the election in a landslide. They do not foresee any other outcome. As a train rumbled by, drowning him out and shaking his beer, Baxter paused. After it passed, he explained how Middletown was an All-American City when they were growing up. But the economy declined. Jobs moved overseas. The mall is about dead now. <strong>The once grand home that belonged to the owner of a defunct paper mill has become low-income housing.</strong> Almost all the storefronts downtown are boarded up, including the movie theater. The pawn shops are the only thriving businesses. Baxter, 50, joined the Army after high school. After 20 years, he came back a decade ago. \u201cEverything went in reverse,\u201d he said. <strong>\u201cSomething is keeping us locked in a time warp here.\u201d</strong> <strong>-- The backdrop of our conversation at the trackside bar is described by J.D. Vance in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547\">Hillbilly Elegy.</a>\u201d </strong>Vance grew up here as the son of an alcoholic, drug-addicted mother and an absent father. The 31-year-old was mostly raised by his grandparents. He joined the Marines after high school and wound up matriculating at Yale Law School. Now he lives in San Francisco and works at an <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jd-vance-770a9047\">investment fund</a> controlled by Peter Thiel, the billionaire PayPal founder. <strong>Vance writes poignantly and personally about the many problems afflicting the white working class, including the decaying social structure: divorce, domestic violence, declining church attendance and so on. </strong>He writes in one passage about mothers \u2013 including his own \u2013 putting Mountain Dew in their infants\u2019 bottles because they don\u2019t know any better, which leads to decaying teeth. In another, his mom makes him give her a urine sample so she can pass it off as her own. He\u2019s certainly not alone: more people died in this county of drug overdoses last year than natural causes. <strong>This book is all the rage in D.C. right now, and it has been at or near the top of the bestseller lists for two months.</strong> Though The Donald is never mentioned, elites in both parties are studying \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d as a sort of Rosetta Stone to understand the conditions that allowed for the rise of Trumpism. As he\u2019s promoted it, <strong>Vance often draws parallels between Trump\u2019s appeal and the drug epidemic pummeling Middletown.</strong> Calling the GOP nominee an \"opioid for the masses,\" <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/opioid-of-the-masses/489911/\">he explains</a>: \u201cWhat Trump offers is an easy escape from the pain. \u2026 (His) promises are the needle in America\u2019s collective vein. \u2026 Trump is cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they\u2019ll realize it.\u201d <strong>Though Ohio was in the union during the civil war, this region is culturally Southern.</strong> Most here migrated from Kentucky or Tennessee in search of good-paying factory jobs\u2014or their parents did. Vance's grandparents are among them. Driving around town, I spotted a Confederate flag with a middle finger superimposed in the middle flying in one yard. Both of that man\u2019s neighbors had Trump signs out front. <strong>The most provocative argument in the book is that working-class whites do not take enough personal responsibility for the horrible situations they find themselves in.</strong> Vance, who has been a regular contributor to National Review, warns that the culture now \u201cbreeds a sense of learned helplessness.\u201d He relays vignette after vignette about lazy Middletownians abusing the social safety net and taking advantage of a system that\u2019s designed to give them a hand up. One character in the book quits his job because he hates waking up early but then takes to Facebook to blame \u201cthe Obama economy.\u201d <strong>-- While folks who live in the Acela Corridor hear a lot about how much people loathe Trump, it would be challenging to overstate the level of antipathy for Clinton here. </strong>\u201cEverybody is worried about what their future is going to hold. I have no idea, but I do know Obama\u2019s made it worse. And Hillary will make it worser,\u201d said Cecil Graham, 50, a machine operator at a box factory. \u201cI really don\u2019t get how it\u2019s as close as it is.\u201d As the self-described independent talked about how he never liked George W. Bush either, a Clinton commercial appeared on the television he was staring at. It showed young women looking at themselves in the mirror as Trump uttered nasty comments about females. Graham pointed it out. <strong>\u201cThe little stupid sh*t that they\u2019re running ads on, no one cares about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d </strong> These are some of the people Hillary was apparently speaking of when she said that half of Trump\u2019s supporters are irredeemable and in a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d (She has since <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jump-on-clintons-deplorables-remark/2016/09/10/91a3c148-775c-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html?tid=a_inl\">expressed regret</a> for the gaffe.) <strong>-- The most recent Washington Post/ABC News national poll found that white men without a degree prefer Trump over Clinton by about 60 points nationally.</strong> This constituency has moved in Trump\u2019s direction far more than any other demographic compared to 2012: \u201cOhio\u2019s electorate is going to be somewhere around 80 percent white in 2016. That\u2019s significantly higher than the national average, which will be somewhere around 70 percent,\u201d writes Kyle Kondik, the author of a new book called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/why-trump-will-do-better-in-ohio-than-he-does-nationally/\">The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President</a>.\u201d \u201cNationally, about 29 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have a bachelor\u2019s degree, while just about 26 percent of Ohioans do. \u2026 <strong>The Ohio electorate should be about half non-college white in 2016</strong> (again, larger than the national average). So a growing educational difference in white voter preference \u2026 works more to Trump\u2019s advantage in Ohio than it might in some other states.\u201d <strong>I interviewed a dozen guys at the hole-in-the-wall bar here. None had attended college. They all work with their hands and believe that statistics suggesting an economic recovery, however lethargic it might be, are fabricated.</strong> Bill Clinton starts a bus tour today through the Mahoning Valley, a region of the state that similarly suffers from the effects of deindustrialization. Hillary Clinton, visiting the state yesterday for the first time since Labor Day, campaigned in Toledo and Akron. <strong>The Democratic path to victory rests on doing well enough in what operatives call the three C\u2019s\u2014Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati\u2014to offset the margins Trump will run up in places like Middletown and Youngstown.</strong> <strong>-- Middletown happens to be in Ohio\u2019s Eighth Congressional District, which John Boehner represented for 25 years. </strong> A couple of the guys at the bar I hung out at last Friday during happy hour expressed unprovoked disdain for the former Speaker of the House, who resigned last year. <strong>\u201cYears ago I really liked him but then he lost his balls,\u201d said Ron Susong, 73, a masonry contractor.</strong> \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he was working with Obama. Where is the man in the Republican Party today? There\u2019s a difference between being a man and a boy. Just because you\u2019re 21 doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a man. As Arnold (Schwarzenegger) said, they\u2019re all girlie-men in Washington. <strong>When John resigned, I thought, \u2018We need somebody with balls to lead the party.\u2019 Then Trump came along. He definitely has the balls to do what\u2019s right for the country.</strong>\u201d  Susong, who voted for Ross Perot in 1992 and Bill Clinton in 1996, said he is clear eyed that no one leader can solve the problems ailing Middletown. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody gonna make us great again in four years, unless the good Lord comes back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hopefully Donald will get us trending in the right direction again.\u201d <strong>-- Warren Davidson won the March special election to replace Boehner. Then he promptly joined the Freedom Caucus \u2013 the very group of conservative hardliners who drove the Speaker to quit.</strong> The freshman congressman, who lives in a more affluent area of the district, said Trump was not his first choice in the primaries but that it\u2019s exciting to see him bringing ancestral Democrats into the GOP\u2014and that constituents keep asking him where they can find Trump signs. \u201cTrump offers a very clear contrast to the status quo that Hillary is an iconic representative of,\u201d he told me over breakfast at Bob Evans. \u201cTrump is a very clear disruptor.\u201d Davidson said there are more movement conservatives in the House than he realized when he was running, and not as many suffer from Stockholm syndrome as he believed. He stressed that he plans to never personally criticize Boehner despite his membership in the Freedom Caucus, and he added that the two had a pleasant lunch in the district recently. The congressman really liked \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547\">Hillbilly Elegy</a>\u201d and has been recommending the book to colleagues, including Hal Rogers, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet J.D. Vance,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cOne of the points he makes \u2026 is that there\u2019s no government program that\u2019s going to fix some of the stuff that our country is wrestling with. It\u2019s a moral issue. \u2026 People are very defensive about their own culture and values. Identity is so central to all of us. I think his book does a good job of defining that tension.\u201d <strong>WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:</strong> <strong>-- Hurricane Matthew made landfall in Haiti</strong>, threatening a largely rural corner of the impoverished country with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida.

Two more states and the District of Columbia will raise the minimum later in the new year. The greatest increase will apply to companies in New York City with at least 10 employees. Minimum-wage workers at these businesses will receive a raise of $2 an hour on Saturday as the floor increases from $9 to $11. More-modest increases will apply to smaller firms in New York City and companies elsewhere in the state. Workers also will receive substantial raises in states carried by President-elect Donald Trump. In Arizona, the hourly minimum will increase from $8.05 to $10. The floor will increase from $7.50 to $9 in Maine, from $8.50 to $8.90 in Michigan and from $8 to $8.50 in Arkansas.

In 2014, for instance, voters approved increases in Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota. In Arizona in November, voters approved an initiative to increase the minimum wage by <a href=\"http://results.arizona.vote/2016/General/n1591/Results-State.html\">a comfortable margin</a> of 58 percent to 42 percent.

Individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible.\" Cholesterol warnings have been around in the United States since at least 1961 and have helped shift eating habits from foods like eggs. But scientific thinking on the issue has evolved. Nutritionists now believe that foods high in cholesterol may not significantly affect cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease in healthy adults. But individuals with health issues such as diabetes should continue to avoid cholesterol-rich foods. The government's new stance on dietary cholesterol is in line with that of other nations, which do not single out cholesterol as an issue. Yet it should not be confused with officials' continued warning about high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood -- something that has been clearly linked to heart disease. Experts emphasize that while the hard limit on cholesterol consumption was removed, that doesn't mean a green light to eat cholesterol-laden foods with abandon. \"Cautions about cholesterol intake are addressed in the text of the [guideline] report, including a clear statement that people do not need to obtain cholesterol through food and should limit their intake of cholesterol and saturated fat as much as possible through healthy eating patterns,\" American College of Cardiology President Kim Allan Williams said. <em>[<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/19/cholesterol-in-the-diet-the-long-slide-from-public-menace-to-no-appreciable-effect/\">Cholesterol in the Diet: The Long Slide from Public Menace to No \u201cAppreciable\u201d Effect</a>]</em> Williams explained that Americans can meet these recommendations by eating more unprocessed foods -- especially fruits, vegetables and whole grains -- and by replacing unwanted sugar and fat with plant-based foods, including whole grains, fruits and vegetables. The federal government's influential Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which were released Thursday, are updated every five years, and the debate over saturated fats, red meat, caffeine and salt was especially intense this time around. The guidelines are the basis of everything from school lunch programs to the diets promoted in bestselling books, but in recent years some scientists have begun to question the one-size-fits-all approach. A growing body of research supports the theory that a person's genetic makeup or microbiome (the organisms that live on or inside of you and help to make you who you are) plays a key role in how food affects the body -- and that the impact can be different from one individual to another. That work supports a more personalized approach to diet, which some researchers argue have argued is the future of nutrition science. <strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/11/20/the-diet-study-that-upends-everything-we-thought-we-knew-about-healthy-food/\">This diet study upends everything we thought we knew about \u2018healthy\u2019 food</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/10/27/cutting-sugar-from-kids-diets-appears-to-have-a-beneficial-effect-in-just-days/\">Cutting sugar from kids\u2019 diets appears to have a beneficial effect in just 10 days</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/14/scientists-sort-of-settle-debate-on-low-carb-vs-low-fat-diets/\">Scientists (sort of) settle debate on low-carb vs. low-fat diets</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2015/10/29/doritos-deconstructed-this-is-what-the-additives-in-your-food-look-like-all-those-ingredients-in-your-food-you-cant-pronounce-this-is-what-they-look-like/\">Doritos, deconstructed (mesmerizing photos of the 34 processed ingredients in your favorite snack)</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/05/hot-topic-could-regularly-eating-spicy-foods-help-you-live-longer/\">Hot topic: Could regularly eating spicy foods help you live longer?</a> <i>For more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter </i><a href=\"http://wapo.st/1LDkwOZ\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>here</i></span></a><i>.</i> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 81810.0, "text": "American College of Cardiology", "wiki_title": "enwiki:American College of Cardiology", "entityid": 1358769}, {"id": 81820.0, "text": "Williams", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Kim A.

We've constructed millions of multi-story, single-family homes where the master bedroom is on the second floor, where the lawn outside requires weekly upkeep, where the mailbox is a stroll away. We've designed neighborhoods where everyday errands require a driver's license. We've planned whole cities where, if you don't have a car, it's not particularly easy to walk anywhere \u2014 especially not <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/06/next-big-infrastructure-crisis-age-proofing-america/5865/\">if you move gingerly</a>. This reality has been a fine one for a younger country. Those multi-story, single-family homes with broad lawns were great for Baby Boomers when they had young families. And car-dependent suburbs have been fine for residents with the means and mobility to drive everywhere. But as the Baby Boomers whose preferences drove a lot of these trends continue to age, it's becoming increasingly clear that the housing and communities we've built won't work very well for the old. A <a href=\"http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/housing_americas_older_adults\">new report</a> from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies and the AARP renews this warning. What will happen to Baby Boomers stuck in suburbia once they can't drive anymore? Where will an aging population with more disabilities live when we've built so little accessible housing? How will they pay for homes late into life when there aren't enough modest-sized homes or aid programs to help afford them? For all of these reasons, we're rapidly approaching a serious clash in America between housing stock and community design on one hand, and demographics on the other. In 1990, less than 5 percent of U.S. counties had a population where adults over 50 made up more than 40 percent of the community (that was 156 counties). By 2010, this was true of 33 percent of all U.S. counties (or 1,031 of them): Put another way: The U.S. population over age 65 is expected to include 73 million people by 2030 (that's about 33 million more than today). Where do most of these people currently live? In the suburbs: And in single-family homes: Most of those homes don't have the kind of basic \"universal design\" features that older residents will need, like extra-wide hallways, no-step entries, living spaces on the ground floor, or accessible light switches and door levers. The Harvard report cites 2011 American Housing Survey data concluding that just 1 percent of housing units in America have all five of these features. In theory, such adjustments will mean making homes more accessible for everyone: for dads pushing strollers, children on crutches, anyone who just wants a grandparent to visit. But the prospect of age-proofing our housing stock and neighborhoods raises some thorny policy questions: Should communities require private homeowners or commercial builders to incorporate accessibility features? (Some <a href=\"http://concretechange.org/visitability/visitability-defined/\">already do.</a>) Are we willing to invest in transit in communities that currently don't have much of it? Can we make room for <a href=\"http://accessorydwellings.org/adu-regulations-by-city/\">\"accessory dwelling units\"</a> \u2014 like little backyard cottages where grandma might live \u2014 that are currently illegal in many cities? And there's another question not raised by the Harvard report, but it's an equally important one that's been voiced by researcher Arthur C. Nelson: If many Baby Boomers wind up leaving the large single-family homes they've long occupied \u2014 where they no longer want to mow the lawn or climb the stairs \u2014 will there be enough young homeowners wanting to buy them? America is the midst of shifts in both demographics and housing preferences <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/housing/2013/03/aging-baby-boomers-and-next-housing-crisis/4863/\">that suggest there may not be</a>. If you are already worried about what an aging America will mean for entitlement programs, health care spending or the labor pool, you should probably add housing to that list, too.

Cindy Martinez, a 34-year-old mother of two who lives outside Atlanta, doesn\u2019t know how she contracted necrotizing fasciitis and myositis, but it has already cost her both of her feet and her right hand. They were amputated last week, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Cindysmiracle/timeline\">according to a Facebook page</a> set up to support Martinez and her family. Necrotizing fasciitis, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, is a serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and kills the body\u2019s soft tissue. Martinez was diagnosed with the terrifying disease after she was admitted to the emergency room on May 25 with severe pain in her left shoulder blade, according to the family. The next day, doctors were fighting to save her life. Three days after that, doctors were forced to remove dead tissue down the left side of her body. A <a href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/w4v22v5n\">GoFundMe campaign</a> has raised more than $76,000 to assist the family with medical bills. Martinez\u2019s husband, David, who met his wife in the Marines and currently works as a Gwinnet County police officer, has spent weeks by his wife\u2019s side in the hospital, missing work. \u201cSure, she was a little scared,\u201d David Martinez <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/cindy-martinez-update-georgia-woman-flesh-eating-bacteria\" target=\"_blank\">told People</a> following his wife\u2019s triple amputation, \u201cbut she was able to fight through that fear and say, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 \u201d Like many victims, Martinez was young and otherwise healthy when she became infected. Her husband called the source of the disease \u201ca mystery.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any injury, and initially at home when she was feeling the pain, I looked at where the pain was at and I didn\u2019t notice anything, and that\u2019s what\u2019s troubling,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/gwinnett-mother-battling-flesh-eating-bacteria/nmbky/\">told ABC affiliate WSB</a> earlier this month. Ruth Berkelman, a professor of epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/hard-to-know-how-gwinnett-woman-got-flesh-eating-b/nmcbM/\">told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> that it\u2019s not unusual for patients to be unsure about how they contracted the infection. She said the entry point can be as forgettable as a minor cut or insect bite. \u201cUsually when you talk with patients, if you ask them if they remember having a cut or something, they say \u2018yes,\u2019 but not always,\u201d Berkelman told the AJC. \u201cMaybe there was an insect bite or mild abrasion they didn\u2019t pay attention to, but it does happen when people don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly how many necrotizing fasciitis cases there are each year in the United States. According to the CDC, there are \u201cabout 650 to 850 cases\u201d of necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A streptococcus each year. But, the CDC says, \u201cthis is likely an underestimation as some cases are probably not reported.\u201d And the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation notes that the CDC does not track cases caused by the other bacteria. But the foundation, a nonprofit founded by two survivors of the disease, say the group A <i>Strep </i>statistics<i> </i>combined \u201cwith the as yet unquantifiable numbers of people who contract NF from other forms of bacteria\u201d are \u201cfrightening.\u201d The disease works like this, according to the CDC: The speed at which necrotizing fasciitis attacks \u2014 often originating as simple soreness or swelling \u2014 takes many victims by surprise. Zach Motal\u2019s case was no different. One day in May, Motal was strolling beside the surf in Fort Myers, Fla. The next day, he was lying on an operating table having the lower half of his right leg amputated. In between, his foot swelled up and turned purple, unleashing such excruciating pain on the 46-year-old that he showed up to the hospital in tears thinking it was broken, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/man-loses-leg-flesh-eating-bacteria-wading-gulf/story?id=30872958\">according to ABC News</a>. \u201cI figured they were going to put a cast on me and tell me to go home,\u201d Motal told ABC. \u201cI would never in a million years imagine I had a flesh-eating bacteria in me.\u201d Through a small cut on his toe, Motal had contracted group A streptococcus, according to ABC. The bacterium, doctors explained to Motal, is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis. The flesh-eating infection is caused by multiple kinds of bacterium, including <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em>, which thrives in the Gulf of Mexico and other warm salty waters during the warmer months. Recent water tests in Fort Myers came back negative for <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em> and doctors have told Motal that he could have contracted group A streptococcus from \u201canywhere,\u201d according to ABC. Motal, however, is convinced he came into contact with the bacteria during his walk along the beach. \u201cThe water had just splashed over my foot and I didn\u2019t think anything about it,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.nbc-2.com/story/28973441/natasha-story#.VVO1Z_lVhBc\">told NBC affiliate WBBH.</a> Aside from being contracted via an open wound, <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em> can also be transmitted by eating raw shellfish, <a href=\"http://duval.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/infectious-disease-services/vibrio-vulnificus-faqs/index.html\">according to the Florida Department of Health</a>. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/vibriov.html\">According to the Centers for Disease Control</a>: Two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/health/vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria/\">CNN reported</a>, \u201cthe Florida Department of Health reported 11 deaths and 41 infections. Texas reports 15 to 30 annual cases, while Maryland State officials say they see an average of 25 infections per year.\u201d According to the CDC, <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em> infections prove fatal approximately 50 percent of the time. The infection \u2014 which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and blistering skin lesions \u2014 usually kills victims within 24 to 48 hours as it spreads through the bloodstream and begins laying waste to precious tissue. With so little time to act, doctors are sometimes forced to diagnose patients without a blood test and by relying on experience, <a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-07-23/health/fl-mystery-bacteria-20100723_1_bacteria-vibrio-septic-shock\">according to a 2010 Sun Sentinel story</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s really a surgical emergency,\u201d Brian Brown, a physician assistant, <a href=\"http://www.nbc-2.com/story/28973441/natasha-story#.VVO1Z_lVhBc\">told NBC affiliate WBBH</a>. \u201cThey need to get in and do a fasciotomy and clean out the fascial plane and maybe even amputation.\u201d Doctors had no choice but to amputate Motal\u2019s leg. He told ABC the leg has 2,500 stitches and looks like a prop from a \u201chorror movie.\u201d A master carpenter and avid motorcycle rider, Motal told ABC he\u2019ll have to find a new profession and hobby. Even so, he told ABC, it could have been worse. \u201cThe doctor said if I hadn\u2019t have got here when I did, within four hours I would have been dead,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI think something does need to be done. The public does need to be aware that there\u2019s a flesh-eating bacteria.\u201d <strong>MORE READING:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/12/clinic-worker-might-have-been-exposed-to-bioterror-bacteria-at-tulane-research-center-report-says/\">Clinic worker might have been exposed to bioterror bacteria at Tulane research center, report says</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/19/superbug-bacteria-linked-to-2-deaths-after-exposure-at-ucla-hospital/\">FDA warns about medical scopes after \u2018superbug\u2019 bacteria hits UCLA hospital</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/04/the-mysterious-and-unchanging-2-billion-year-old-creature-that-would-make-darwin-smile/\">The mysterious 2 billion-year-old creature that would make Darwin smile</a> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 82010.0, "text": "ABC", "wiki_title": "enwiki:American Broadcasting Company", "entityid": 62027}, {"id": 82020.0, "text": "AJC", "wiki_title": "enwiki:The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "entityid": 623714}, {"id": 82030.0, "text": "Gulf Coast", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Gulf Coast of the United States", "entityid": 11969}, {"id": 82040.0, "text": "Centers for Disease Control", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "entityid": 6811}, {"id": 82050.0, "text": "Alabama", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Alabama", "entityid": 303}, {"id": 82060.0, "text": "United States", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 82070.0, "text": "Emory University", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Emory University", "entityid": 42730}, {"id": 82080.0, "text": "Atlanta", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Atlanta", "entityid": 3138}, {"id": 82090.0, "text": "Facebook", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Facebook", "entityid": 5949664}, {"id": 82010.0, "text": "Gwinnet County", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Gwinnett County, Georgia", "entityid": 96769}, {"id": 82011.0, "text": "Fla.", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Florida", "entityid": 18933066}, {"id": 82012.0, "text": "ABC", "wiki_title": "enwiki:ABC News", "entityid": 318094}, {"id": 82013.0, "text": "WBBH", "wiki_title": "enwiki:WBBH-TV", "entityid": 2556754}, {"id": 82014.0, "text": "NBC", "wiki_title": "enwiki:NBC", "entityid": 21780}, {"id": 82015.0, "text": "CNN", "wiki_title": "enwiki:CNN", "entityid": 62028}, {"id": 82016.0, "text": "Fort Myers", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Fort Myers, Florida", "entityid": 109328}, {"id": 82017.0, "text": "Louisiana", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Louisiana", "entityid": 18130}, {"id": 82018.0, "text": "Sun Sentinel", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Sun-Sentinel", "entityid": 715880}, {"id": 82019.0, "text": "People", "wiki_title": "enwiki:People (magazine)", "entityid": 507970}, {"id": 82020.0, "text": "Florida Department of Health", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Florida Department of Health", "entityid": 13754665}, {"id": 82021.0, "text": "Gulf of Mexico", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Gulf of Mexico", "entityid": 987125}, {"id": 82022.0, "text": "Mississippi", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Mississippi", "entityid": 16949861}, {"id": 82023.0, "text": "Maryland", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Maryland", "entityid": 18752}, {"id": 82024.0, "text": "Texas", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Texas", "entityid": 29810}, {"id": 82025.0, "text": "WSB", "wiki_title": "enwiki:WSB-TV", "entityid": 745606}, {"id": 82026.0, "text": "Rollins School of Public Health", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Rollins School of Public Health", "entityid": 772642}]}

Not so for Julie Brill, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who really wants you to know about the time she fell for an email phishing scam. \"These are not the prince-from-Nigeria types of attacks of the past that we're used to,\" Brill said in a recent interview. \"These are deeply sophisticated.\" Phishing scams can affect anyone \u2014 even, as it turns out, high-ranking federal officials whose whole jobs revolve around regulating corporate data security practices. The irony isn't lost on Brill, who is trying to turn her personal story into an object lesson for consumers like you and me. As Brill tells it, the saga began earlier this year. A business contact of hers \u2014 Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge \u2014 sent her an email with an innocuous-looking Google Drive attachment. But after clicking on the link and entering in some of her personal information on the resulting page, she soon realized the truth: This was not a Google site at all. Instead, online criminals had muscled their way into Kimmelman's email account and begun sending fake emails in his name to everyone in the account's address book. (I, too, got a fraudulent email from Kimmelman's attackers.) \"I was busy, I saw an email from this person, I opened it, tried to interface with it,\" said Brill. \"And I pretty soon realized this was a false email from [someone] who was trying to get my data.\" Luckily, even though Brill had given out some of that data, she had made sure that the criminals wouldn't be able to hijack her own accounts. She'd taken advantage of two-factor authentication, a security measure that prevents someone from logging into a website unless they can also reproduce a special code sent to a separate device such as your mobile phone. Two-factor or two-step verification has been adopted by Google, Amazon and other major websites to combat the rise of digital fraud. The loss of information took place on Brill's personal computer, so nothing in the FTC's systems was affected, she said. But she did consult with the agency's IT managers. \"Once they found out I had two-factor authentication and I had changed some passwords, they were comforted that I had done all that I could do,\" said Brill. \"If it had been an attack on our systems, they would have jumped into high gear right away.\" So how did the hackers break into Kimmelman's address book in the first place? That mystery may never be solved. \"<span class=\"s1\">It was either a random hack, or someone \u2026 knew those on my contact list would expect me to have secret documents to share,\" Kimmelman joked in an email. \"If not a random hack, my reputation may be ruined!\"</span> Kimmelman has since switched email accounts. Brill is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/22/a-top-privacy-advocate-is-leaving-the-federal-trade-commission/\">leaving the FTC</a> at the end of the month to enter the private sector \u2014 a decision that was unrelated to this incident. But her imminent departure makes this an opportune time to highlight the risks of not having two-factor authentication enabled for your sensitive online accounts. \"I say to groups, 'How many of you have two-factor authentication?' and I don't see enough hands,\" said Brill. \"So I say to folks, 'If you get nothing else out of this talk, please go home and turn on two-factor authentication.' \" "}], "saliency": [{"id": 82110.0, "text": "Nigeria", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Nigeria", "entityid": 21383}, {"id": 82120.0, "text": "Public Knowledge", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Public Knowledge", "entityid": 18935347}, {"id": 82130.0, "text": "Amazon", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Amazon.com", "entityid": 1063896}, {"id": 82140.0, "text": "Google", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Google", "entityid": 1092923}, {"id": 82150.0, "text": "Kimmelman", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Gene Kimmelman", "entityid": 39926039}, {"id": 82160.0, "text": "Brill", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Julie Brill", "entityid": 27104240}, {"id": 82170.0, "text": "FTC", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Federal Trade Commission", "entityid": 182215}]}

We are not to actively look at them. We are only allowed to report on what has been out there because this is stolen material and trafficking in it is, in itself, a criminal act.\u201d This stolen material has been dredged up by a hacking effort known as \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d against Sony Pictures Entertainment, which produced \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists who sign on to a government plot to assassinate North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un. Reams of internal Sony information have spilled from the hack \u2014 e-mails, data on salaries and business considerations \u2014 not to mention the fact that producer Scott Rudin called star Angelina Jolie a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/16/brad-pitt-seth-rogen-media-sony-hacks\">minimally talented spoiled brat.</a>\u201d Sony demands that media organizations do not republish the hacked material. In a strongly worded Dec. 14 letter to publishers, superlawyer David Boies wrote that Sony \u201cdoes not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading, or making any use of the Stolen Information.\u201d Those who dis Sony on this matter are in trouble, according to Boies, who writes that the company will have \u201cno choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you.\u201d The Times has taken that threat seriously. In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/business/sony-pictures-demands-that-news-organizations-delete-stolen-data.html\">same-day piece on the Boies letter</a>, the newspaper turned up its nose at other outlets that have participated in the disclosures: \u201cUntil now, the data has provided a feast for traffic-hungry websites like Fusion and those owned by Gawker Media, along with some mainstream news organizations like Bloomberg, which last week posted an article \u2014 without citing names \u2014 revealing details of employee medical records that were made public by the hackers.\u201d As for its own approach, that same Times piece disclosed, \u201cThe Times has reported on some Sony emails and company-related data based on the accounts of other news organizations and on statements from Sony executives. Sony representatives have acknowledged the authenticity of the emails and data.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/17/new-york-times-sony-emails_n_6340776.html?1418835891\">Huffington Post media reporter Michael Calderone obtained further clarification from The Times</a>, which outlined a balancing act: \u201cThe Sony situation poses difficult questions. We don\u2019t condone hacking into private computer systems. We also don\u2019t like depriving our readers of information they care about.\u201d Actor Brad Pitt, Jolie\u2019s husband, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/brad-pitt-seth-rogen-speak-up-about-medias-handling-of-sony-hack/\">found something unsavory</a> in the reporting frenzy: \u201cI don\u2019t see a difference in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/celebrity-victims-of-news-of-the-world-hacking-a-whos-who/2011/07/18/gIQA04ldMI_blog.html\">News Corp hacking phone calls</a> and hacking e-mails. I don\u2019t think we should be able to participate,\u201d said Pitt. \u201cI think someone\u2019s conversation, whether in e-mail or in person, should be private. We shouldn\u2019t be participating and these sites that are disseminating them should stop. They won\u2019t. And we should stop reading them. We won\u2019t. It\u2019s more of an indictment on us, I think.\u201d Pitt sees no difference in these two things; the law sees an enormous one. As the Erik Wemple Blog has noted previously, Supreme Court jurisprudence protects U.S. media organizations that lawfully receive information that\u2019s been unlawfully obtained. Say what? Yes \u2014 if some scoundrel hacks into a computer or illegally tapes a phone call and then posts it to the Internet, there\u2019s nothing illegal about passing it along. That very protection is encased in <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-1687.ZS.html\">a 2001 Supreme Court case</a>, <em>Bartnicki v. Vopper</em>, which involved a scandalous recording of a phone conversation, one that had been allegedly recorded illegally, that ended up in the hands of talk radio host Frederick Vopper. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that Vopper acted within the law: \u201c[A] stranger\u2019s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.\u201d Clay Calvert, a University of Florida professor, told the Erik Wemple Blog for a previous post, \u201cIf the news media lawfully obtain truthful information about a <strong>matter of public significance</strong>, then the government may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent an interest of the highest order.\u201d For further analysis, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/15/can-sony-sue-media-outlets-who-publish-the-stolen-sony-documents/\">see this post by Eugene Volokh</a>, who notes that two of the six justices in the majority opinion opined that the information needs to be of \u201cgreat public concern.\u201d Bold text added to highlight the triviality of much of the Sony hacking oeuvre. Is a Hollywood producer\u2019s attitude toward Angelina Jolie a matter of public significance? Are the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/12/the-sony-hack-and-the-line-between-transparency-and-retribution/\">negotiations of New York Times journalists with Sony executives</a> of matter of public significance? Is the fact that Sony bigwig Amy Pascal <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sony-executive-amy-pascal-apologizes-for-embarrassing-e-mails-that-have-leaked/2014/12/11/99077c96-8162-11e4-81fd-8c4814dfa9d7_story.html\">had to apologize over racially insensitive e-mails</a> a matter of public significance? Well, she apologized and her replacement appears likely, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-hack-hollywood-assesses-amy-758635\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>. Case closed on public significance. Appeals to suppress the work of these hackers automatically elicit sympathy. In the pantheon of American leaking heroes, the Guardians of Peace aren\u2019t Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers); they aren\u2019t W. Mark Felt (Watergate); they aren\u2019t <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/10/18879209-psst-wanna-hear-a-secret-other-famed-leakers-in-recent-history?lite\">Jeffrey Wigand</a> (tobacco); they aren\u2019t Edward Snowden (National Security Agency). Instead, they\u2019re a group that has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/16/sony-pictures-hackers-invoke-911-while-threatening-theaters-that-show-the-interview/\">threatened terrorism</a> on theaters that show \u201cThe Interview.\u201d Yet it\u2019s not the media\u2019s job to judge the people who steal information. The media\u2019s job is to judge the stolen information itself: If it\u2019s worth publishing, then publish. Some may argue that media trafficking in the Sony documents will only <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-in-the-sony-e-mail-scandal-our-cyber-nightmares-are-coming-true/2014/12/15/9e84856e-8488-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html\">encourage other hackers</a> to break into other companies\u2019 systems.

Researchers focused on a newly identified strain of the bacterium known as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/05/19/mrsa-lives-for-a-week-on-seat-back-pockets-in-airplanes-research-shows/\">MRSA,</a> or methicillin-resistant<em> Staphylococcus aureus, </em>that they found in people in Denmark. Although most individuals who become infected with MRSA don\u2019t get it from food, the study suggests that this poultry-associated strain may be more easily transmitted from food to people. The findings underscore the importance of reducing the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals to boost their growth, the researchers say. The issue is expected to be discussed prominently at an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/09/20/the-worlds-leaders-are-finally-holding-a-summit-on-superbugs/\">unusual meeting at the United Nations </a>on Wednesday. The high-level summit is focused on the rising threat posed by superbugs, microbes that can\u2019t be stopped with drugs. It is only the fourth time that the world\u2019s decision-makers have addressed a health concern at the U.N. General Assembly. MRSA, which is resistant to several antibiotics, is commonly found in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/risk-of-mrsa-skin-infection-still-lurks-in-nfl-10-years-after-brandon-nobles-case/2014/08/10/e3afdb62-1f06-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html\">locker rooms</a>, hospitals, military barracks and other settings where large numbers of people congregate. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections that can cause life-threatening <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/sepsis-is-fast-moving-and-deadly-but-there-are-ways-to-stop-it-cdc-says/2016/08/23/8a0febca-6940-11e6-99bf-f0cf3a6449a6_story.html\">sepsis</a>. Until now, researchers have known that livestock can carry the bacteria, putting farmers, farmworkers, veterinarians and others who work directly with animals at greater risk. MRSA bacteria have also been shown to be present in foods, including pork, beef and dairy, although outbreaks from food contamination have been rare. \u201cThis shows that everyday consumers \u2014 the general public \u2014 are also potentially at risk,\u201d said Lance Price, a member of the research team and director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University. As part of the study, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, U.S. and Danish researchers utilized a national, multiyear MRSA database at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. They identified 10 people in urban areas who had carried or been infected with this new strain. None had worked on farms or had direct exposure to food animals. Regardless, no Danish livestock showed evidence of this particular type of bacteria. Using genetic analysis to compare the strain found in the 10 study subjects and those found in people, livestock and food products from other European countries, the researchers were able to trace the bacteria to poultry imported from those other countries, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Samples of the strain in the Danes were virtually identical, a finding that suggests all of the individuals were exposed from a common source, most likely contaminated chicken or turkey. \u201cOur findings implicate poultry meat as a source for these infections,\u201d said Robert Skov, a researcher at the Copenhagen institute. In the United States and other countries, officials monitor the food supply for intestinal bacteria such as <em>E. coli, </em>salmonella and campylobacter. But staph bacteria, including MRSA, are not included. Although food is still a relatively minor source of MRSA transmission, Price said the research shows the superbug is changing and evolving in real time. \u201cThe more we treat huge gobs of animals with antibiotics and huge gobs of humans with antibiotics,\u201d he said, the greater the likelihood that relatively rare types of transmission will become more common.

Bezos, the next owner of The Washington Post, says he doesn\u2019t have all the answers for what\u2019s ailing the newspaper industry or for the financially challenged news organization he is preparing to buy. But he says he\u2019s eager to start asking questions and conducting experiments in the quest for a new \u201cgolden era\u201d at The Post. In his first interview since his $250 million purchase of The Post was announced in early August, Bezos said his basic approach to operating the business will be similar to the philosophy that has guided him in building Amazon.com from a start-up in 1995 to an Internet colossus with $61 billion in sales last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we\u2019ve stuck with for 18 years, and they\u2019re the reason we\u2019re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you replace \u2018customer\u2019 with \u2018reader,\u2019 that approach, that point of view, can be successful at The Post, too.\u201d Bezos, 49, spoke via phone from Seattle on Friday, four days before he was scheduled to visit The Post for the first time since the announcement of its purchase from The Washington Post Co. and the controlling Graham family. The sale, which shocked the news industry, is expected to close in October. Bezos said his major contribution to the business will be in offering his \u201cpoint of view\u201d in discussions with the paper\u2019s leadership about how the publication should evolve. He also said he provides \u201crunway\u201d \u2014 financial support over a lengthy period in which the management can experiment to find a profitable formula for delivering the news. \u201cIf we figure out a new golden era at The Post .\u2009.\u2009. that will be due to the ingenuity and inventiveness and experimentation of the team at The Post,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there with advice from a distance. If we solve that problem, I won\u2019t deserve credit for it.\u201d During his visit Tuesday and Wednesday, Bezos plans to meet with Post publisher Katharine Weymouth and top managers of the paper\u2019s business and editorial operations. He will tour the newsroom in downtown Washington and the production plant in suburban Springfield, Va. Wednesday\u2019s visit will be bracketed by meetings with Post journalists \u2014 first with about 20 reporters and editors in the morning and concluding with a town hall-style meeting with the entire newsroom in the afternoon. The last time Bezos encountered a roomful of the paper\u2019s journalists was in 1999, when he was the guest of Katharine Graham, the company\u2019s late chairman, during a luncheon interview with reporters and editors. Based on his comments in the interview Friday, Bezos appears unlikely to make any major decisions or pronouncements during his visit or propose any immediate changes. He said he is eager to meet with and listen to managers and learn about the news organization\u2019s operations. The Post is the first newspaper that Bezos has owned and will be operated as a stand-alone business, independent of Amazon. Bezos intends to keep his \u201cday job\u201d as chairman and chief executive of Amazon and will continue living in Seattle, where the company is based. Bezos is one of the world\u2019s richest men, with a net worth of around $24 billion, based on the current value of his Amazon stock holdings. His deep pockets, technological savvy and reputation as a long-term strategic thinker were among the attributes that Post Co. chief executive Donald E. Graham cited in selling him The Post after 80 years under the Graham family\u2019s control. Graham said he saw no alternative to continued investment, which would be difficult for a publicly traded company. Graham and Weymouth, his niece, quietly put the business up for sale earlier this year after concluding that The Post required an owner capable of making sustained investment in it. Bezos agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s important for The Post not just to survive, but to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cThe product of The Post is still great. The piece that\u2019s missing is that it\u2019s a challenged business. No business can continue to shrink. That can only go on for so long before irrelevancy sets in.\u201d In the interview, Bezos stressed that he has no immediate fixes for newspapers in general or for The Post, which is beset by Web-based competition that has weakened its advertising base and steadily sapped its print readership. \u201cDon was helpful in interviews [following the purchase] when he said, \u2018Mr. Bezos is a businessman, not a magician,\u2019\u2008\u201d Bezos said. \u201cI thanked him for that afterwards. In my experience, the way invention, innovation and change happen is [through] team effort. There\u2019s no lone genius who figures it all out and sends down the magic formula. You study, you debate, you brainstorm and the answers start to emerge. It takes time. Nothing happens quickly in this mode. You develop theories and hypotheses, but you don\u2019t know if readers will respond. You do as many experiments as rapidly as possible. \u2018Quickly\u2019 in my mind would be years.\u201d But Bezos suggested that the current model for newspapers in the Internet era is deeply flawed: \u201cThe Post is famous for its investigative journalism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pours energy and investment and sweat and dollars into uncovering important stories. And then a bunch of Web sites summarize that [work] in about four minutes and readers can access that news for free. One question is, how do you make a living in that kind of environment? If you can\u2019t, it\u2019s difficult to put the right resources behind it. .\u2009.\u2009. Even behind a paywall [digital subscription], Web sites can summarize your work and make it available for free. From a reader point of view, the reader has to ask, \u2018Why should I pay you for all that journalistic effort when I can get it for free\u2019 from another site?\u201d Although he said he reads The Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal regularly, Bezos didn\u2019t grow up immersed in newspapers or dreaming of being involved with one. His \u201clove affair,\u201d he said, has always been with \u201cthe printed word in all its forms.\u201d Amazon started as an online book retailer; it now publishes its own books. It has also moved into video production, competing with Netflix and others in streaming original programs. Bezos\u2019s wife, MacKenzie, is a published novelist. The Internet and Amazon\u2019s launch of the Kindle e-reader convinced him that the printed word doesn\u2019t have to be on paper. \u201cThe key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author\u2019s world,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cGreat writers create an alternative world. It doesn\u2019t matter if you enter that world\u201d via a digital or printed source. After Graham broached the idea of Bezos buying the paper earlier this year, Bezos said he spent two months contemplating what he could bring to the business. He was convinced that The Post was \u201can important institution,\u201d and he said he was optimistic about its future. But he needed time to think over a third issue. \u201cI had to convince myself that I could bring something to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI discussed this at great length with Don. I thought I could, because I could offer runway and some skill in technology and the Internet and a point of view about long-term thinking, reader focus and the willingness to experiment.\u201d Added Bezos: \u201cI\u2019m a genetic optimist. I\u2019ve been told, \u2018Jeff, you\u2019re fooling yourself; the problem is unsolvable.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think so. It just takes a lot of time, patience and experimentation.\u201d Asked how he saw The Post \u2014 as a local, national or international news organization \u2014 Bezos demurred. \u201cThat\u2019s a question that needs to be answered in concert with the leadership team of The Post. Is it local? Or national? Is it something new?\u201d Whatever the mission, he said, The Post will have \u201creaders at its centerpiece. I\u2019m skeptical of any mission that has advertisers at its centerpiece. Whatever the mission is, it has news at its heart.\u201d Craig Timberg contributed to this article.

Dressed in tan pants and a white shirt open at the collar, Bezos offered few clues about his plans for The Post as he met with editors and company executives, they said. Bezos, who is expected to close the deal for The Post in about a month, maintained a genial, inquisitive manner punctuated by occasional outbursts of laughter. Among others, Bezos met with members of The Post\u2019s editorial board on Tuesday, including Fred Hiatt, the editorial page editor. Hiatt said it is too early to know how active Bezos will be in shaping the newspaper\u2019s editorial policies. But Hiatt observed, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely legitimate for an owner to have an editorial page that reflects his world view. Some owners don\u2019t want to get involved, some work through the publisher, and some are very [directly] involved. I got the sense that he\u2019s still in exploring mode.\u201d On Wednesday, Bezos plans to have breakfast with investigative journalist Bob Woodward, lunch with senior editors and a meeting with about 20 other Post journalists. After a tour of the newspaper\u2019s production plant in Springfield, he will hold a town hall meeting with the entire newsroom. During Tuesday\u2019s visit, Bezos attended the 4:30 meeting as more of an observer than a participant, as is common with visitors to the newsroom. Bezos sat to the left of Executive Editor Martin Baron, near the head of the large table around which editors gather each day to discuss upcoming stories. He listened attentively as editors discussed the stories slated for Wednesday\u2019s front page and on the front pages of other sections. Anne Kornblut, deputy national editor, noted that two stories on Syria weren\u2019t as conflicting as they might initially appear \u2014 even though one argued that members of Congress support military strikes while the other said many are opposed. With both stories in the paper, Bezos quipped, \u201cYou know you can\u2019t be wrong!\u201d to laughter around the room. After editors offered their views on upcoming stories, he was offered a chance to voice his opinion. \u201cDo you want to weigh in, Jeff?\u201d asked Managing Editor Kevin Merida. Bezos replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, except that I\u2019m impressed with the process.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

And above all, \u201cDon\u2019t be boring.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/post-staff-meets-the-new-boss/2013/09/04/90e87226-158f-11e3-a2ec-b47e45e6f8ef_gallery.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">In a whirlwind series of meetings</a> over two days, the <a href=\"http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=AMZN\" title=\"washpost.bloomberg.com\">Amazon.com</a> billionaire charmed and disarmed rooms full of skeptical journalists with a relentlessly upbeat vision that evoked The Washington Post\u2019s best traditions while promising to update them for a technologically advanced new era. The Bezos plan for the news organization he has agreed to buy for $250 million centers on recreating the \u201cdaily ritual\u201d of reading The Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories. He was bullish about creating that experience on tablet computers, lukewarm about the prospects of doing so on the Web, and reassuring about the future of the old-fashioned newspaper itself \u2014 at least for the foreseeable future. \u201cPeople will buy a package,\u201d Bezos said at one meeting of reporters and editors. \u201cThey will not pay for a story.\u201d Bezos seemed relaxed throughout two days of meetings, including a town-hall-style session in The Post\u2019s community room before hundreds of journalists. He spoke without notes and joked often, punctuating some of his witticisms and self-deprecating comments with explosive laughter. He remained poised and good-humored from his perch on stage at the town-hall meeting despite fighting a balky sound system. Bezos also repeatedly emphasized the importance of investigative journalism and said he was prepared to stand up to pressure in reporting stories that government officials might seek to suppress. He also said his political views were already in line with those of The Post\u2019s editorial page and would defer to its editor, Fred Hiatt, on many matters. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to have an opinion on every issue,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know much about things like Syria and foreign entanglements. I\u2019m happy to let the experts opine on that.\u201d Among those in attendance at the newsroom-wide meeting were former executive editors Ben Bradlee and Leonard Downie Jr., former managing editor Robert Kaiser and star investigative reporter Bob Woodward, lending the event an intergenerational bridge to the newspaper\u2019s storied past. (Donald E. Graham, whose family controlled the newspaper for 80 years, was not there, but his niece, Post publisher Katharine Weymouth, was in attendance). After 90 minutes of hearing Bezos lay out his thoughts, Bradlee, 92, counted himself among those who came away with a positive first impression. \u201cI thought he was original,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what impressed me the most.\u201d Throughout the day, Bezos returned to his idea of using tablets as a key vehicle for reaching a new generation of readers. While saying The Post\u2019s print editions will remain for many years, he said tablet computers could offer readers a look and feel similar to a traditional printed paper. \u201cYou have to figure out: How can we make the new thing? Because you have to acknowledge that the physical print business is in structural decline,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pretend that that\u2019s not the case. You have to accept it and move forward. . . . The death knell for any enterprise is to glorify the past, no matter how good it was, especially for an institution like The Washington Post, which has such a hallowed past.\u201d In comments that cheered the newsroom, Bezos said The Post needed to grow in both revenue and readers, though he declined to say whether The Post newsroom would grow. \u201cWhat has been happening over the last several years can\u2019t continue to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf every year we cut the newsroom a little more and a little more and a little more, we know where that ends.\u201d Or as he put it repeatedly in meetings: \u201cAll businesses need to be forever young. <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> If your customer base ages with you as a company, you\u2019re Woolworth\u2019s.\u201d Asked about the irony of his interest in buying a newspaper and Amazon\u2019s practice of not commenting for many news stories, Bezos laughed and responded, \u201cThe most powerful minds can hold powerful inconsistencies.\u201d He said one reason he often declines to comment is because he does not want his competition to know about his plans. \u201cWe\u2019re not as silent or secretive as we\u2019re sometimes portrayed,\u201d he said of Amazon, conceding that \u201cwe are on the quiet side.\u201d Bezos, who will remain in Seattle after his purchase of The Post closes in October, sidestepped a question about his future involvement in the Washington area. \u201cI would never out-Don Don. Impossible,\u201d he said, referring to Graham. \u201cI will have to do this as Jeff. And it\u2019s going to be different for so many reasons, and one of them is that I\u2019m going to be in Seattle.\u201d When asked to discuss Amazon\u2019s motives in cutting off Web services for WikiLeaks in 2010, a time of intense government scrutiny of the anti-secrecy site\u2019s disclosure of confidential military and diplomatic documents, Bezos said that the decision was made by unit managers and was not the result of government pressure. The company has previously said that WikiLeaks violated Amazon\u2019s terms of service. Yet Bezos made clear that though he believes in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d he sees The Post\u2019s traditional watchdog roles as essential. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfect and our elected officials are not perfect and our regulators are not perfect,\u201d he said in the newsroom question-and-answer session. \u201cThe credibility that an organization like The Washington Post brings is incredibly important.\u201d The reaction to the new boss from around The Post\u2019s newsroom was widely favorable. \u201cWhat was most impressive was the combination of humility \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t have all the answers yet \u2014 and the confidence that he will somehow figure it out,\u201d said Marc Fisher, a veteran reporter and former Metro columnist. Added Valerie Strauss, another Post veteran, who writes an education blog: \u201cThere was a lot he didn\u2019t say, but what he did was well received. It\u2019s going to be a very different place.\u201d Post reporters have already begun to refer to Bezos as \u201cEl Jeffe,\u201d a play on the Spanish word for \u201cchief\u201d or \u201cboss.\u201d He ended what amounted to a two-day charm offensive by recalling for the newsroom his own encounter, as a young boy in the 1970s, with the impact of Post journalism. After apologizing for potentially embarrassing Woodward, Bezos said: \u201cI watched the Watergate hearings on my elbow on the living-room floor next to my grandfather, who didn\u2019t turn them off. And so these things make an impression.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

Without the newspaper, the firm\u2019s focus on Kaplan will be starker than ever, even as it maintains an odd assortment of other subsidiaries \u2014 including a Phoenix-based cable business and a recently acquired <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/washington-post-buys-forney/2013/07/18/afaa634e-efa2-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">supplier to boiler manufacturers</a> \u2014 and hunts for ways to redeploy a small mountain of cash from the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/the-sale-of-the-washington-post-how-the-unthinkable-choice-became-the-clear-path/2013/08/06/46216532-fed7-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">$250 million sale of the newspaper division</a> to billionaire <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jeffrey-bezos-washington-posts-next-owner-aims-for-a-new-golden-era-at-the-newspaper/2013/09/02/30c00b60-13f6-11e3-b182-1b3bb2eb474c_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Jeffrey P. Bezos</a>. A few surprising acquisitions this year have led to speculation that Graham will turn his company into a mini-<a href=\"http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=BRK/A\" title=\"washpost.bloomberg.com\">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, the legendary holding company run by longtime Graham family adviser and former company board member Warren Buffett. As of June 30, before the sale to Bezos, the company was sitting on nearly $387 million in cash. Graham bats down the idea of replicating Buffett\u2019s success. \u201cNo other company can be compared to Berkshire. There\u2019s nothing comparable and never will be,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cWe\u2019ll do acquisitions in different business lines, but not in the expectation we can do anything remotely like Berkshire.\u201d The Post Co. has long had a history of making modest investments in seemingly random industries, building those businesses patiently over time. While some have gone sour, others have become major parts of the company. Executives and longtime shareholders say that approach is unlikely to change. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily a playbook,\u201d said Mark Hughes, director of research at Lafayette Investments in Ashton, which owns <a href=\"http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=WPO\" title=\"washpost.bloomberg.com\">Post Co. shares</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t think they wake up in the morning and say, \u2018We want to get into health care.\u2019 I think they\u2019ll look at everything coming down the road, and if it makes sense they\u2019ll make sensible offers.\u201d The Post Co. branched into education, cable and television stations through these kinds of deals, allowing it to diversify far beyond newspapers and become a $4 billion company of many different units, each run very independently. Kaplan\u2019s higher-education business was turbocharged by a $165 million acquisition in 2000, when The Post Co. acquired Quest Education, an Atlanta-based chain of vocational schools. This year, the company bought a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/washington-post-buys-hospice-firm/2012/10/01/f9100d34-0bd4-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">majority stake of Celtic Healthcare</a>, a small hospice company, and purchased Forney, a global supplier of products for power and industrial boilers. <b></b>Beyond Kaplan, which is based in New York, 20 percent of the company\u2019s revenue last year came from Phoenix-based <a href=\"http://www.cableone.net/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.cableone.net\">Cable One</a>, which provides cable services largely in the country\u2019s Western region. Ten percent was from <a href=\"http://www.washpostco.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=62487&p=irol-businessbroadcasting\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.washpostco.com\">Post-Newsweek Stations</a>, which owns six television stations in Texas, Florida and Michigan. That means that without the newspaper, none of the company\u2019s major divisions will be based in the Washington region. The company is also putting up for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/washington-post-co-explores-the-sale-of-its-downtown-headquarters/2013/02/01/97bb90c8-6c71-11e2-ada0-5ca5fa7ebe79_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">sale</a> its long-held downtown Washington headquarters, which is assessed by the D.C. government at nearly $80 million. Even without further acquisitions, there are plenty of other areas for the company to tinker with in its existing business: publications such as Slate, The Root and Foreign Policy; the WaPo Labs team, which is working on technology that curates news for readers; and the social-media marketing firm SocialCode. The company also retains its 16.5 percent share of <a href=\"http://classifiedventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"classifiedventures.com\">Classified Ventures</a>, which runs Cars.com and Apartments.com. The Post Co.\u2019s share is worth about $300 million before taxes, according to Craig Huber, an independent media analyst. The company\u2019s stock has been on a tear all year, rising nearly 70 percent in 2013. The day the sale of the newspaper was announced in August, the company\u2019s stock rose to a five-year high \u2014 an indication of how big a drag the newspaper had become to the company in the eyes of Wall Street. Another contributing factor to the stock\u2019s rise: The company\u2019s TV stations have become more highly valued as the sector profits from fees charged to cable and satellite operators for the right to air local TV signals. It is not clear what the new company will be named. Graham has even asked one of his daughters, an opera singer, to help him come up with ideas, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk openly about internal discussions. But there is an even bigger question looming than the name, and that\u2019s who will succeed Graham. In five years, he will be the age of his mother, Katharine Graham, when she stepped down from the chief executive post in 1991 and handed the reins to her son. There are no obvious choices to outside observers. Katharine Weymouth \u2014 The Post\u2019s publisher and Graham\u2019s niece \u2014 is leaving the company to continue running the paper for Bezos, though she remains a member of the board. Graham\u2019s daughter Laura Graham O\u2019Shaughnessy runs <a href=\"http://www.socialcode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.socialcode.com\">SocialCode</a>, which nearly doubled its revenue last year but remains a small part of the company. Then there is Andy Rosen, who has run Kaplan since 2008. He is not a member of the family but is deeply respected by Graham. In the meantime, executives are hoping the sale of the newspaper, however painful, means that the company\u2019s top management will have more time to attend to the less visible businesses. \u201cWithout Newsweek and The Post to distract them, they\u2019ll have a little more time to perhaps give us a little more attention,\u201d said Tom Might, head of Cable One. \u201cWe get such little attention. A little more would probably be good.\u201d But the majority of Graham\u2019s attention may well be focused on Kaplan, which says it is trying to differentiate itself from competitors by emphasizing quality and offering refunds to students who do not like what they see. \u201cMost value investors who own [Washington Post Co. stock], we don\u2019t invest for WaPo Labs,\u201d said James Pan, a shareholder since 2005. \u201cWe just hope that frankly <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> Kaplan gets back to something resembling normal.\u201d As Graham wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in February, \u201cthe future of The Washington Post Company is the future of Kaplan.\u201d He added that even if Kaplan saw modest improvement in 2013, \u201cwe have a long way to go.\u201d Since its acquisition, no single division has ever accounted for a bigger share of the company\u2019s revenue than Kaplan. But after years of being the company\u2019s cash cow, the education division\u2019s profits have been clobbered by tougher government regulations and scandals over predatory marketing techniques that damaged the reputation of for-profit schools. Kaplan lost more than $105 million in operating income last year, compared with a profit of $206 million in 2008. The most recent quarters have shown some improvement. Operating income in the <a href=\"http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDA1TURZM05EY3dKbk4xWW5OcFpEMDFOdz09JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1UaGVXYXNoaW5ndG9uUG9zdENvbXBhbnlfMTBRXzIwMTMwODA3LnBkZg==\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"services.corporate-ir.net\">second quarter</a> was $23.7 million, compared with $3.7 million a year before. There is also more competition from nonprofit and state schools, which are increasingly offering online courses, an area where Kaplan has been active for more than a decade. \u201cWe see the increasing acceptance of online instruction as good for us, as we have superior expertise in this arena,\u201d Melissa Mack, Kaplan\u2019s spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Kaplan University also has offered a trial period to students, one of several ways it is trying to rehabilitate its image. Graham says demand will remain high for the education Kaplan offers. \u201cPeople around the world will be hungry for a quality education (of many types) for a long, long time to come,\u201d Graham said in his e-mail. \u201cKaplan can help serve those students.\u201d <b></b> <b></b> <b></b>Kaplan\u2019s test prep business lost money last year, as it has for a while now, though its numbers are improving. And the company\u2019s international business \u2014 now more than twice the size of the test prep division\u2014 is growing in places such as Singapore. <b></b>\u201cThere\u2019s still no resurgence, but at least it\u2019s starting to show signs of a bottom the last four quarters,\u201d said Huber, the media analyst. \u201cI think the world of Don Graham as a manager,\u201d said Hughes, of Lafayette Investments. \u201cThey\u2019re playing a tough hand there, between the difficulties with the newspaper and Kaplan.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

The wonks are also at this tech conference. Wonks from the East Coast, from <i>Washington</i>, that beacon of ineptitude and regulation and, worst of all, inertia. Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal is here, for a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with a Hewlett-Packard executive, comparing the challenges of conducting a war in Afghanistan to the challenges of \u201cbringing together PC and printer groups\u201d in a large corporation.

Adrian Fenty used to be the future \u2014 at least in the District of Columbia, where he was born and raised and served as neighborhood commissioner, city councilman and mayor. As moderator for two sessions at the conference, Fenty introduces himself to attendees as \u201ca new transplant to the West Coast\u201d who has been \u201cout here for the better part of a year.\u201d His conference bio places him in the \u201cvisionary\u201d category, as if the designation explains the last seven years of his whiplashed r\u00e9sum\u00e9: swept at age 35 into the mayor\u2019s office on the promise of change, evicted from that office after one term of change that was too disruptive. More than half of District residents thought the city was moving in a favorable direction in the months leading up to the Democratic primary for mayor in 2010, and yet <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/30/AR2010013002452.html\">Fenty\u2019s approval ratings tanked</a> and focus groups found his leadership style offensive. That disparity \u2014 the gap between effect and affect \u2014 was his undoing. Fifty-four percent of Democratic voters went for his primary challenger Vincent Gray, nearly 30 years older. Now, three years after being booted from the Wilson Building and 10 months after separating from his wife, the native son has gone into semi-self-exile from his home town. Fenty is seen around Washington now and then \u2014 chaperoning his twin sons as they train at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, getting a bite on 14th Street NW with former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau, attending millionaire businessman <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/09/22/mark-ein-weds-sally-stiebel-the-a-list-bachelor-finally-finds-his-bride/\">Mark Ein\u2019s glittery September wedding</a> in Georgetown \u2014 but he is mostly gone. Where exactly did he go? The literal answer is Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s fashioning a second act in a land that is more tolerant of brashness, of radical change at high speeds. The vaguer answer, though, is somehow more fitting: Adrian Fenty has gone up into the cloud.<b></b> There have been only a handful of mayors of the District of Columbia, and all but one of them have remained rooted to their city after leaving office. Walter E. Washington, the first, became a partner in the D.C. office of a New York law firm. Sharon Pratt Kelly, the third, and Anthony Williams, the fifth, became and remain local consultants. Marion Barry, the second, later became the fourth and is the city councilman for Ward 8 through at least 2017, perhaps for eternity. Last month Adrian Fenty, the sixth mayor of Washington, severed his last business tie with the city. He ended his two-year tenure as special counsel at the Dupont Circle law firm Bruce J. Klores & Associates and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/09/25/adrian-fenty-lands-another-job-in-silicon-valley/\">took a job</a> with the Palo Alto, Calif., office of the law firm Perkins Coie, whose clients include the digital gods of the third millennium. The sixth mayor\u2019s new constituents \u2014 his employer\u2019s clients, that is \u2014 are Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Amazon.com (headed by Washington Post owner <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jeffrey-bezos-washington-posts-next-owner-aims-for-a-new-golden-era-at-the-newspaper/2013/09/02/30c00b60-13f6-11e3-b182-1b3bb2eb474c_story.html\">Jeff Bezos</a>). The firm, in its Sept. 24 announcement, called Fenty a \u201csavvy strategist.\u201d Indeed. The former wunderkind mayor has emerged from the other side of an embarrassing political defeat to become an adviser to wunderkinds. This is Fenty the expat, who after his primary defeat <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/15/AR2010091503011.html\">said he would not run for office again</a>, who has been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/08/adrian-fenty-and-his-budding-romance-with-laurene-powell-jobs-billionaire-widow-of-apple-co-founder-steve-jobs/\">romantically linked to billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs</a>, widow of Apple co-founder Steve. He declined to be interviewed for this article. Conversations with Fenty\u2019s friends, colleagues in Silicon Valley and former colleagues in D.C. paint a picture of his life today: Fenty 3.0, iterating up and out of his hometown. \u201cIt puzzles me how someone who was purportedly so ardently committed to the city\u2019s well-being could suddenly turn it off and have no public role at all in how we move forward,\u201d e-mails Randy Speck, a Chevy Chase neighborhood commissioner who worked on and contributed to Fenty\u2019s first mayoral campaign. \u201cMaybe he feels rejected and has simply reciprocated.\u201d A better word is \u201cdisenchanted,\u201d according to Fenty\u2019s lifelong friend and former D.C. attorney general <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/09/AR2010090907203.html\">Peter Nickles</a>, who had lunch with Fenty over the summer in the District. Nickles makes note of Fenty\u2019s \u201cprior life\u201d and \u201cnew life,\u201d and how the ex-mayor doesn\u2019t keep up with local politics anymore. \u201cI think he was disappointed enough in the political process that he probably didn\u2019t feel he needed to spend a lot of time following events,\u201d Nickles says. \u201cI think he was going through these issues with his wife and his family, and also determining the perennial question you ask when you get out of college, when you finish your first job, when you retire: \u2018What do I wanna do with the rest of my life?\u2019 And he had a lot of opportunities.\u201d In the seven months after he left office in January 2011, Fenty booked five gigs that signaled his transition from public official to private guru: an \u201coutside adviser\u201d to both a Philadelphia accounting firm and foreign-language software publisher Rosetta Stone, a \u201cstrategic adviser\u201d on government matters to the Herndon office of information-technology consultancy Capgemini, special counsel at his friend and fundraiser Bruce Klores\u2019s law firm, and an \u201cadvisory board member\u201d at Georgetown\u2019s EverFi, an education technology company. His value? Connections. Klores\u2019s firm had a long-standing case involving the State Department, which was giving its lawyers the runaround, Klores says, until Fenty was dispatched \u201cto talk the language from one person in government to another to get them to understand the bigger picture of the case.\u201d Fenty connected EverFi directly to government officials with whom he\u2019d previously networked, helping the company transition its business from small markets such as the Mississippi Delta to school systems in major cities. Access is invaluable, says EverFi\u2019s president and founder, Tom Davidson, and Fenty delivered it. \u201cYou can\u2019t throw a cat in this town without hitting a former politician trying to get involved with technology companies,\u201d Davidson says. Fenty has been welcomed with open arms out West because \u201cSilicon Valley is targeting these intractable social issues in a way that it never really has before.\u201d Fenty\u2019s issue is education, and it has carried him to California. Within days of leaving office in 2011, Fenty branded himself as \u201ca national leader in the area of urban education reform\u201d when he joined the roster of celebrity speakers at the Greater Talent Network. He met Laurene Powell Jobs that year at an education conference in Houston, joined the board of her education nonprofit in February 2012 and met investor Marc Andreessen, a Netscape co-founder, at one of its events. That September, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/former-dc-mayor-adrian-fenty-joins-internet-investment-firm-that-backed-facebook-skype/2012/09/26/160c1654-080f-11e2-858a-5311df86ab04_blog.html\">Fenty became a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d</a> to his hotshot venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, which manages a multibillion-dollar fund from its headquarters in Menlo Park. Perkins Coie partner Buddy Arnheim had a casual lunch with Fenty in California around that time at the suggestion of John Devaney, a partner in the firm\u2019s D.C. office, where Fenty\u2019s wife, Michelle, used to work. As of last month, Fenty had an office two doors down from Arnheim at the Palo Alto office, a 10-minute drive from Andreessen Horowitz. He spends about three days a week as counsel in Perkins Coie\u2019s Emerging Companies & Venture Capital practice, where his business-development portfolio is likely to eventually consist of a couple dozen start-ups and a handful of institutional investors. The balance of his week is spent on Andreessen Horowitz and weekend visits to the District, where his teen sons reside with his parents, Phil and Jan Fenty. Michelle Fenty\u2019s job as the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/michelle-fenty-ex-mayors-wife-takes-job-in-caribbean/2012/01/19/gIQAu7ZtBQ_blog.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s representative in Trinidad and Tobago</a> is based in its capital of Port-au-Spain; their 4-year-old daughter, Aerin, stays with her. Adrian Fenty <a href=\"http://www.siliconbeat.com/2013/09/25/adrian-fenty-ex-dc-mayor-turned-andreessen-advisor-moving-to-silicon-valley/\" target=\"_blank\">told the Silicon Beat blog last month</a> that he\u2019s living in Palo Alto with a friend whom he\u2019s known \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Fenty isn\u2019t talking about his personal life, though it has popped into the news this year in January when <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/adrian-fenty-and-wife-michelle-have-separated/2013/01/14/f58f2368-5e89-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_blog.html\">he separated from Michelle</a> and in August when The Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/08/adrian-fenty-and-his-budding-romance-with-laurene-powell-jobs-billionaire-widow-of-apple-co-founder-steve-jobs/\">revealed his \u201cbudding romance\u201d</a> with one of the richest women on the planet. His most recent interaction with the District was a small one. During the first week of October, he <a href=\"https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/reward-the-unpaid-capitol-officers-who-risked-their-lives-today\" target=\"_blank\">set up a crowdfunding Web page</a> to raise money for Capitol Police officers who were working unpaid during <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-effort-to-end-fiscal-crisis-collapses-leaving-senate-to-forge-last-minute-solution/2013/10/16/1e8bb150-364d-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">the government shutdown</a>. His introduction on the page began \u201cBeloved D.C. family,\u201d then mentioned how he spends \u201csome time in California\u201d and described the usefulness of \u201cgroup action tech\u201d and the funding platform Crowdtilt. Crowdtilt is a San Francisco start-up that is funded in part by Andreessen Horowitz. Trying to do good while hawking a product. That is Silicon Valley in 2013. This is Adrian Fenty, private citizen.<b></b> Malcolm Gladwell takes the stage in a cavernous underground ballroom of the Union Square Hilton in San Francisco. Haloed by his frizz of hair, the author preaches to thousands of listeners about \u201csocial risk-taking,\u201d about how disruptive ideas upset people, about how all successful entrepreneurs and innovators possess at least two shared traits: 1. A sense of urgency. 2. A disagreeable attitude, wherein \u201cdisagreeable\u201d means \u201csomeone who does not require the approval of others to go forward.\u201d Gladwell might be describing Adrian Fenty, whose supporters and critics point to his go-go-go attitude as a distinguishing characteristic. Fenty is also at this BoxWorks 2013 tech conference as a moderator and bold-faced name \u2014 partly because he is a \u201cvisionary\u201d and partly because Box, the file-sharing and cloud-computing company presenting the conference, is also part of Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s portfolio. You might also say he\u2019s here because of two women: Michelle Rhee, whom he was smart (or reckless?) enough to hire as chancellor of schools and who elevated his own profile, and Laurene Powell Jobs, whom he was lucky (or smart?) enough to meet and befriend. The Silicon Valley cliche is thriving here at BoxWorks, with innovator-disrupters paying at least $800 for the privilege of mingling with people who are so forward-thinking that they\u2019re practically doing somersaults down the Hilton\u2019s escalators to the frenetic Partner Pavilion, where sponsors court potential investors and customers with tag lines such as \u201ctrust in the cloud\u201d and \u201cget collaboration in context.\u201d This is Fenty\u2019s world now. Forty-five minutes after Gladwell wraps up his keynote, Fenty and California\u2019s lieutenant governor are sitting next to each other in white leather seats as featured speakers in a smaller adjoining ballroom. Each wears a charcoal suit with a blinding-white dress shirt. Gavin Newsom is polished, poised, charming, without a word or hair out of place. Fenty is slouched. His speech has a slight slur, as it always has, that is partially excused by his surferlike demeanor. It\u2019s obvious which one of these ex-mayors still holds elected office. Their conversation is titled \u201cRevolutionizing Democracy in the Digital Age.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m representing the East Coast,\u201d Fenty says during his introduction. \u201cYou\u2019re representing the West Coast.\u201d \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d Newsom replies. \u201cYou go to the East Coast to join something. You come to the West Coast to <i>start </i>something.\u201d Halfway through the conversation, Newsom draws a line from Gladwell\u2019s keynote speech to Fenty, saying that being indifferent to one\u2019s constituency is sometimes an essential part of leadership. \u201cYou, Adrian, are an example of this \u2014 doing audacious things,\u201d Newsom says, referring to Fenty\u2019s 2007 school takeover, which installed Rhee, who closed dozens of schools, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/23/AR2010072303093.html\">fired hundreds of teachers</a> for underperformance and set in motion the backlash that would end his political career. \u201cYou paid a political price by not getting reelected,\u201d Newsom adds, \u201cbut we are all beneficiaries of the principles you stood for.\u201d The ex-mayors carp about the \u201cconstraints of formal authority,\u201d about taking hits for taking a stand, and this rhetoric blends in with Box\u2019s conference slogan, which seems both idealistic and somehow threatening: \u201cThere\u2019s no end to possible.\u201d Fenty closes his chat by declaring that Box is \u201ca product that works,\u201d reminding everyone that this conference is ultimately a commercial. The feeling here (and everywhere in Silicon Valley, really) is that government is a major drag unless you know how to work it. And people like Adrian Fenty know how to work it, or at least work around it. Fenty, says Buddy Arnheim of Perkins Coie, will be a sounding board for companies that must negotiate new challenges as the government catches up to technology on issues ranging from privacy to cross-border development. And his simultaneous association with Andreessen Horowitz makes him a \u201ctruly unique\u201d player in Silicon Valley. When approached by this reporter after his chat with Newsom, Fenty is amiable but puzzled that anyone would be interested in the life of an \u201cex-politician.\u201d He then moves on to quick conversations with young tech wonks who want to pick his brain about education reform (the documentary \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Q6D28C?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B003Q6D28C&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspos09-20\" title=\"www.amazon.com\">Waiting for \u2018Superman,\u2019</a>\u200a\u201d featuring Rhee, comes up) and immigration policy (he\u2019s frustrated with the \u201ctypical Washington\u201d meekness of Democrats) and his life in California (he\u2019s having \u201ca ton of fun\u201d). And he does things that he was criticized for <i>not </i>doing in the latter years of his mayorship. He shakes hands. He poses for photos. He mingles and lingers, smiley and easygoing and generous with his time. Then he slips into the other ballroom to watch software executives talk about the \u201cFuture of Cloud.\u201d<b></b> <b></b> The cloud, of course, is where all our stuff is, or is going. It is, in some ways, the Internet itself, or the parts of the Internet where we put content so it can be shared, stored or edited across the space-time continuum. Government is also headed there. In this prior life, Fenty was known for being hard-wired to his BlackBerry, for responding directly to constituent e-mails within hours. His most substantial overture to the District\u2019s nascent start-up scene was made by his chief technology officer, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/04/AR2009010401235.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Vivek Kundra</a>, who helped organize a 2008 contest called Apps for Democracy, which reportedly cost the city $50,000 and garnered 47 civic-minded Web applications valued at $2.6 million \u2014 all in the name of making government data and services more accessible to citizens. But the hands-on vigor for technology he\u2019s demonstrating out West was not very visible during his four years leading the District, says Peter Corbett, founder and chief executive of iStrategyLabs, the Dupont Circle digital agency that helped jump-start the District\u2019s tech scene six years ago with a series of meet-ups for entrepreneurs. \u201cI never once saw him at a single meet-up or shaking the hand of an entrepreneur, which is a dramatic contrast to [Vincent] Gray,\u201d Corbett says. Granted, Gray assumed office with a richer, more rooted start-up community on his hands than Fenty had at the start of his own term, says Michael Mayernick, the D.C.-based co-founder of Spinnakr, a Web-site data analysis start-up. Mayernick met with Fenty over the summer in the Palo Alto office of Andreessen Horowitz, which invested in Spinnakr in June. Fenty seemed genuinely hungry to learn about the business and fascinated by tech in general, Mayernick says. <b></b>\u201cIt was clear when I chatted with him,\u201d Mayernick says, \u201cthat he saw an alignment between himself and entrepreneurs, in the style of disruption: \u2018I\u2019m going to look at things as they are, and I\u2019m going to do the best thing without regard to institutional inertia.\u2019\u200a\u201d <b></b>Disruption is what he left behind in the District, according to a broad e-mail sampling of community activists and current and former neighborhood commissioners who have either fond, combative or mixed feelings toward Fenty. There are, of course, the bike lanes \u2014 bane or boon, they are visible to the entire city in a way that school reform is not. There is Police Chief Cathy Lanier, a Fenty appointee who shook up the ranks and remains in charge of a respected department that has chipped away at crime. There is rampant development, begun by predecessor Anthony Williams and broadened by Fenty under the banner of \u201csmart growth,\u201d even when individual neighborhoods rallied against its potential impact. There was somehow both a heightened responsiveness on the part of government agencies and an arrogant dismissal of the concerns of the District\u2019s African American population, commissioners say. Fenty moved fast. Fenty moved too fast. Depends on whom you ask. \u201cMy residents of 7C most definitely miss that level of urgency,\u201d if not Fenty\u2019s \u201cabrasive\u201d personality, says commissioner Greg Stewart, who represents the Ward 7 neighborhoods of Capitol View and Richardson Dwellings. Peter Nickles, who in his role as attorney general was criticized for being as antagonistic as Fenty, recalls that on many issues the Fenty administration tackled \u2014 from schools to slumlords, from unpermitted used-car lots to pornography on city employees\u2019 computers \u2014 they were met by entrenched interests that resisted their progressive vision. When the organized opposition won the 2010 primary for Gray, Nickles says, \u201cit was like Peggy Lee in that song \u2018Is That All There Is?\u2019 It was right back to where it was: same old, same old. Maybe that\u2019s what politics is.\u201d Quite simply, \u201cFenty didn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s a popularity contest at the end of the day,\u201d says Ward 4 neighborhood commissioner Martha Mitchell, who campaigned for Gray in 2010. \u201cFolks don\u2019t vote for candidates that they don\u2019t like.\u201d She adds, \u201cStaying power is the real power.\u201d Or maybe going power is. Maybe politics <i>is </i>the same old, same old, and government\u2019s default setting is inertia, and the real innovation is getting out of it, into the private sector, where government experience is a hot commodity, where there is less anguish and a different kind of power. Up there, in the cloud, you\u2019re beholden to like-minded investors and your own ideals, not half a million citizens with half a million concerns. Where did Adrian Fenty go? To a better place, it sounds like, for him. "}], "saliency": []}

But there\u2019s a reason why so many businesses still feed at the government trough. Contracting has its advantages \u2014 if you are lucky enough to win the work. Just listen to Matthew J. Desch, the chief executive of Iridium Communications, the Tysons Corner-based satellite phone company. Somehow amid all the fiscal fights at the federal level, Iridium managed to secure a <a href=\"http://investor.iridium.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=798537\">$400 million, multi-year, fixed-price contract</a> with the Defense Information Systems Agency to provide satellite services to the Defense Department and its federal partners. A second <a href=\"http://investor.iridium.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=799229\">separate deal</a> to support a satellite station in Hawaii could bring $38 million more over five years. You could practically hear the sigh of relief in Desch\u2019s voice as he briefed Wall Street analysts recently on the company\u2019s financial performance. \u201cThese landmark agreements, worth $438 million in total, will provide us with growing and predictable cash flow from our single biggest customer for the next five years,\u201d Desch said. And none to soon. Iridium finds itself in a transition. Growth in its commercial business has been slowing of late, and the company is sinking big dollars into plans to launch a next-generation constellation of satellites to fuel services for years to come. \u201cOur new deal with the U.S. government successfully answers one of the biggest questions we\u2019ve had around our story all year,\u201d Desch said, adding that the federal government accounted for 20 percent of Iridium\u2019s revenue in 2012.

The latest entry in this genre, by Harry Rosenfeld, a former editor at The Post, is a memoir that comes alive as it re-creates the drama of politics and the press during Washington\u2019s tumultuous 1970s. The son of a Jewish furrier, Rosenfeld was 9 years old when he watched his synagogue in Berlin burn during the Nazi pogrom of Kristallnacht. Months later, the Rosenfelds were among the lucky few who managed to escape to the United States before it was too late. In the Bronx, young Harry learned English, then made the most of a summer job in the mailroom of the New York Herald Tribune, working his way up to become a top editor at the scrappy paper, which he loved \u201cfor its ability to unnerve\u201d its \u201cstaid, overstaffed, overmoneyed\u201d rival, the New York Times. When the Trib folded in 1966, Rosenfeld joined The Post. He helped hire Bob Woodward and supervise his Watergate reporting with Carl Bernstein, although the editor was not blind to their faults: Bernstein was \u201cmanipulative\u201d and \u201cabusive,\u201d Rosenfeld observes, while Woodward was \u201cself-serving,\u201d and the two of them deliberately \u201ccompromised [a] source\u2019s confidentiality.\u201d In retrospect, Rosenfeld believes that The Post made \u201ca major mistake\u201d in not learning the identity of Woodward\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-mark-felt-became-deep-throat/2012/06/04/gJQAlpARIV_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">secret source Deep Throat </a>to check his reliability. Decades later, on discovering that it was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lawmans-unwavering-compass-led-him-to-white-house-showdown/2012/05/31/gJQAkIEuFV_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">W. Mark Felt</a> , a top FBI official who jockeyed to succeed director J. Edgar Hoover, Rosenfeld concluded that the leaks were probably motivated by more than just idealism and should have led to additional scrutiny by the newspaper. Nonetheless, Rosenfeld protected his two reporters when higher-ups at The Post wanted them taken off the story, recognizing that those who lusted to replace them were \u201ctoo comfortable and close\u201d to their official sources to dig out the truth. The scene was memorably portrayed in the movie \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d when the disheveled Rosenfeld, played by actor Jack Warden, pleads with a supervisor to give the young reporters a break: \u201cThey\u2019re hungry. You remember when you were hungry?\u201d Mission accomplished, the hard-bitten movie version of Rosenfeld then barks at his underlings: \u201cWoodward, Bernstein, you\u2019re both on the story. Now don\u2019t [expletive] it up.\u201d Rosenfeld doesn\u2019t shy away from dishing dirt about politicians and the press. White House national security adviser Henry Kissinger called Hoover a \u201cmaniacal fag.\u201d A wife-swapping affair among Post Metro reporters nearly led to newsroom fistfights. And Hubert Humphrey deceived the public about the extent of his bladder cancer to try to make one last, futile run for president. At the heart of the memoir is Rosenfeld\u2019s rivalry with his boss and cultural opposite, Ben Bradlee, the handsome, Harvard-educated Bostonian whose intimates included President John F. Kennedy and Post publisher Katharine Graham. \u201cWhen he was a young kid he learned to play [tennis],\u201d Rosenfeld writes disparagingly. \u201cWhen I was a young kid, I dodged Nazis.\u201d Rosenfeld depicts Bradlee as a superficial social climber who second-guessed the selection of a competent new reporter by asking \u201chow I could hire someone that homely. Bradlee wasn\u2019t joking; looks mattered to him.\u201d Bradlee\u2019s romantic involvement with Post writer Sally Quinn, whom he later married, led to the \u201cimmediate doubling of sacred cows in the newsroom,\u201d Rosenfeld complains, as well as to the couple\u2019s meddling in news coverage about themselves. Bradlee\u2019s open bias toward newsroom favorites undermined staff morale, Rosenfeld adds. Even Woodward and Bernstein \u201cfelt they were being robbed of their Pulitzers\u201d by Bradlee\u2019s alleged maneuvering to remove their names from the prestigious award and to substitute that of the newspaper instead. The relationship between the two editors deteriorated. \u201cRosenfeld, you spend your time sticking your thumb in my eye,\u201d Bradlee growled. Rosenfeld admits that his Jewish background gave him a \u201csense of inferiority\u201d that \u201cnever wholly disappeared,\u201d and he concedes that he could be \u201ca pain in the ass\u201d to work with. It all came to a head when the pugnacious editor insisted on publishing a story about Kennedy\u2019s extramarital affair with Bradlee\u2019s sister-in-law, Mary Pinchot Meyer. \u201cBen is not going to settle for getting mad,\u201d a Post executive predicted. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get even.\u201d Sure enough, Rosenfeld says, he learned he was being demoted by reading it in the rival Washington Star. Bradlee erroneously viewed the Meyer story as \u201ca plot to dethrone him,\u201d Rosenfeld writes, because of a \u201ccompulsion to look at the world in personal terms and to not leave unsettled outstanding scores.\u201d Still, the author credits his former boss with being a \u201ctransformative leader\u201d who \u201cmade the Post a great newspaper.\u201d Rosenfeld\u2019s book avoids the sentimental nostalgia of so many journalistic memoirs but is uneven in quality, overburdened with details about his family and career. The prose is as direct and unadorned as its author. At a time when journalism seeks to reinvent itself, Rosenfeld\u2019s story is a reminder of the need for fearless reporting that pursues the truth no matter where it leads. Jeff Bezos would do well to heed that lesson.

Borders? Dead. Barnes & Noble? Life support. Amazon is king. E-books are the present and the future. Have tablet, will read. But in downtown Frederick, Md., Marlene and Tom England are defying the future: They recently opened the Curious Iguana bookstore. It carries books printed on paper. Nonfiction. Poetry. Short stories. That seems insane, right? Some people strolling by certainly think so. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them say: \u2018A bookstore? Who would open up a bookstore these days?\u2019\u2009\u201d Marlene said. \u201cI mean really, the door is open. I can heeaaaaaaaar you.\u201d Marlene has not ventured outside to offer the doomsayers a retort, but if she did, it would be this: Independent bookstores are not dead. In fact, in some of the country\u2019s most urbane and educated communities, they are making a comeback. In an e-tailing world, their resurgence is driven by e-book growth that has leveled off, dyed-in-the-wool print lovers who won\u2019t (or can\u2019t) abandon page flipping, a new category of hybrid reader (the latest mystery, digital; the latest John Irving, print) and savvy retailers such as the Englands, positioning their stores squarely in the buy-local movement and as a respite from screens. The American Booksellers Association, which represents independent bookstores, says its membership \u2014 it hit a low of 1,600 in 2008 \u2014 has grown 6.4 percent in 2013, to 2,022. Sales were up 8 percent in 2012, and those gains have held this year. In the District, sales at Politics and Prose, where <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/30/the-21-books-obama-bought-on-d-c-shopping-trip/\">President Obama </a>and his daughters went Christmas shopping last month, have grown each of the past few years. Its owners pondered an additional outlet in Georgetown, but the original idea for a location fell through. Nationally, while there are still indie bookstores shutting their doors, unable to hold on against the tough head winds, there are more stores opening than closing. Word, the popular Brooklyn indie, just opened a new branch at an old Burger King in Jersey City. Bookbug, in Kalamazoo, Mich., has doubled its size. Novelist <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-08/opinions/41184643_1_saturns-third-floor-jeff-bezos\">Ann Patchett opened a store </a> in Nashville. There are new openings in St. Louis, in Durham, N.C., and beyond. \u201cWe just never bought into the sky-is-falling mentality,\u201d Marlene England said. \u201cYou see the headlines, but you have to dig deep to s<span>ee what\u2019s really happening.\u201d</span> The indie resurgence became publishing\u2019s central narrative this year. Publishers Weekly, the industry\u2019s trade bible, last month named Oren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, and his group\u2019s board as its person of the year, an honor previously given to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345803485?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0345803485&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspost03-20\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a> \u201d author E.L. James and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jeffrey-bezos-washington-posts-next-owner-aims-for-a-new-golden-era-at-the-newspaper/2013/09/02/30c00b60-13f6-11e3-b182-1b3bb2eb474c_story.html\">Jeffrey P. Bezos</a>, the founder of Amazon.com, the owner of The Washington Post and a villain to indie booksellers. \u201cWe are a lot like Mark Twain: The rumors of our death are a little bit exaggerated,\u201d Teicher said. \u201cWe have been counted out for a very long time.\u201d Twenty-five years ago, independents were supposed to vanish when Waldenbooks showed up in malls. They were supposed to vanish when Borders and Barnes & Noble came along with endless selection and comfy chairs. They were supposed to vanish when Costco started selling the latest <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-bully-pulpit-roosevelt-taft-and-journalism-by-doris-kearns-goodwin/2013/11/08/b7662734-40cf-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html\">Doris Kearns Goodwin </a>. They were supposed to vanish when Amazon perfected low prices and fast shipments \u2014 not just for books but even for rowboats, meaning nobody would ever have to leave the house again to shop. \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is that the inevitable death of any kind of physical retailing was a gross exaggeration,\u201d said Laura J. Miller, a Brandeis sociology professor and author of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226525910?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0226525910&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspost03-20\">Reluctant Capitalists: Bookselling and the Culture of Consumption </a>.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of reasons people like going to bricks-and-mortar stores, especially to bookstores that are offering something more than just a convenient shopping experience.\u201d The Englands\u2019 objective when they opened the Curious Iguana was to offer something more. They are experienced in the art of throwback retailing. They own Dancing Bear Toys and Gifts, a popular downtown Frederick toy store specializing in toys without batteries. Even in the face of \u00adXboxes, flying toys and children snatching their parents\u2019 iPhones to play games, the Dancing Bear\u2019s sales have increased every year. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a desire by many to go back to a very simple time,\u201d Tom England said. \u201cKids are starting to play Risk again. People want to touch things. They want to be a little low-tech.\u201d The Englands were pondering opening another toy store in a different downtown, but they love Frederick and realized something special was happening there \u2014 a rebirth fueled by upscale food, high-end antiques and cute cafes. Their toy store\u2019s book section was booming, so they thought of opening a kids bookstore. But people around town pushed them to open a bookstore for general interest. They visited Politics and Prose one morning. It was packed. They saw statistics showing that indie stores\u2019 sales were growing again. And so they took a huge gamble: They moved their toy store off the main street and around the corner, putting the Curious Iguana in its spot. The walls are a warm purple. Edison lights hang from the ceiling. The hardwood floor creaks. And they gave the store a larger mission, too \u2014 sharing a portion of the proceeds with international nonprofit organizations. Sales, the Englands say, are higher than they expected. One recent Saturday afternoon the store was packed with about two dozen customers. \u201cWe need intimate, small places like this that care about the books they pick,\u201d said Lisa Solomon, a Frederick resident holding several children\u2019s books. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a bookstore. It\u2019s more than that.\u201d Ryan Young, 38, dropped $130 on cookbooks, kids titles and some other hardcovers. She said something that many book buyers would be afraid to utter in an indie store: \u201cI\u2019m an Amazon Prime member.\u201d She also admitted to owning and enjoying a Kindle. Lightning did not strike her. That\u2019s because she also said this: \u201cHaving a book in my hands \u2014 nothing stacks up to that.\u201d Young is an emerging positive for indie bookstores: a hybrid reader. About 64 percent of U.S. book buyers prefer reading in both print and digital, according to the Codex Group, which regularly surveys readers. Young reads series mysteries on her Kindle, but literary titles come home in print. Industry statistics show that e-book sales are largely tilted toward genre reading, a trend playing out in Young\u2019s life. \u201cThere has to be a value in both,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are books on my bookshelves that are like my friends. You can go back to them over and over again.\u201d Marlene England is not offended about the Amazon.com remark. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be an either-or,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel guilty for buying e-books. We all do it \u2014 for convenience, for travel, whatever.\u201d E-books, however, have not come to overwhelm bookselling as many experts predicted five years ago. Statistics from earlier this year showed that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/08/e-book-sales-are-leveling-off-heres-why/\">e-book sales </a>were up 5 percent in the first quarter, compared with 28 percent in 2012 and 159 percent in 2011. \u201cThe growth curve really has flattened, so that\u2019s good for us,\u201d said Bradley Graham, a former Washington Post reporter who owns Politics and Prose with his wife, Lissa Muscatine. But many independent bookstore owners, including Graham, concede that e-books are a big part of the industry\u2019s future, so they are embracing the technology. In partnership with Kobo, an Amazon competitor, Politics and Prose and other independent bookstores are selling the company\u2019s e-readers and e-books in exchange for a small cut of sales. Graham says the partnership hasn\u2019t yielded meaningful revenue. More promising, he said, are the store\u2019s other ancillary offerings \u2014 daily author readings, dozens of paid classes, and book-oriented trips. The store recently added beer and wine sales for in-store events. Still, publishing experts say that independents might be fighting for their lives again five or 10 years down the road. College students today \u2014 the book buyers of tomorrow \u2014 are finding a heavy emphasis on digital textbooks in the classroom, and there is a risk they won\u2019t ever become hybrid book buyers. Also, Amazon shows no sign of giving indies any relief on what store owners consider predatory pricing, especially on key titles they need to push. Donna Tartt\u2019s new novel, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316055433?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0316055433&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspost03-20\">The Goldfinch </a>,\u201d is selling for $30 at Curious Iguana. Amazon is selling it for $15.41. And then there\u2019s Barnes & Noble. While the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/20/AR2011012006155.html\">Borders demise </a>was good for indie sales, a Barnes & Noble collapse would be catastrophic for the publishing industry, which depends heavily on the company\u2019s enormous bookselling footprint to move huge inventories, including bestsellers that help finance the more literary offerings that indies typically stock. \u201cI think the independents have been given a break for now,\u201d said Al Greco, who studies publishing at Fordham University. The Englands know the risks. \u201cWe knew exactly what we\u2019re getting into,\u201d Tom said. And besides, Marlene said, \u201cif it all fails, Curious Iguana is a great name for a bar.\u201d "}], "saliency": []}

Over the past few years, Spike Lee has been working on smaller canvases, experimenting with personal narratives (\u201cRed Hook Summer\u201d) or remaking other filmmakers\u2019 work (\u201cDa Sweet Blood of Jesus\u201d and \u201cOldboy\u201d). With \u201cChi-Raq\u201d he\u2019s boldly trying something new yet again, adapting the Aristophanes play \u201cLysistrata\u201d into a contemporary parable set within the culture of guns and gangs on the South Side of Chicago. (The title refers to an unwelcome nickname the city has earned as local gun deaths have exceeded mortality rates in the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts.) Spoken almost entirely in verse, staged as a sometimes ungainly series of polemical set pieces, production numbers and declamatory interludes, \u201cChi-Raq\u201d doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any genre. It\u2019s a satire stuffed into a musical tucked into a melodrama, fused together by Lee\u2019s signature visual brio and Terence Blanchard\u2019s elegant orchestral score. It\u2019s a bit of a mess, but a bit of a masterpiece, too: Just when you think Lee has lost his grip on a movie that can\u2019t decide what it is, he grabs you by the throat with the urgency, passion and instincts that have made him one of America\u2019s great cinematic artists. (\u201cChi-Raq\u201d was produced by Amazon Studios, a company owned by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jeffrey-bezos-washington-posts-next-owner-aims-for-a-new-golden-era-at-the-newspaper/2013/09/02/30c00b60-13f6-11e3-b182-1b3bb2eb474c_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post</a>.) One of Lee\u2019s best moves with \u201cChi-Raq\u201d was finding an electrifying actress to fill its central role: As Lysistrata, Teyonah Parris takes early command of the screen, when her character attends a performance of her boyfriend Chi-Raq Dupree (Nick Cannon), a rapper and gang leader of the Spartans. When his arch-rival Cyclops (Wesley Snipes) \u2014 leader of, what else, the Trojans \u2014 stages an attack onstage, and later sets fire to Chi-Raq\u2019s house, Lysistrata takes shelter with a wise neighbor named Miss Helen, played by Angela Bassett. Together, the women hatch a plan \u2014 in part inspired by the 21st-century tactics of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nobel-peace-prize-goes-to-three-women/2011/10/07/gIQAJdwBSL_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\"> Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee</a> \u2014 to withhold sex from their male partners until the men disavow gun violence. \u201cLock it up!\u201d the women chant, vowing to \u201cdeny all rights of access or entrance\u201d until the shooting stops. In real life, Gbowee has observed that the Liberian sex strike was more effective in garnering media attention than changing behavior. For Lee, the conceit allows him to indulge in some of the same objectification and simplistic sexual politics that often have characterized his work. But it also enables him to take on an entire constellation of social and historical forces that have conditioned African American life, not just in hyper-violent Chicago but throughout the country. In a subplot involving a grieving mother played by Jennifer Hudson, Lee calls out the stop-snitching ethos and glamorization that attach to thug life. And in a fiery sermon delivered by John Cusack\u2019s radical Catholic priest, he takes on gun laws, structural poverty, the NRA, the school-to-prison pipeline and mass incarceration that he hoarsely calls out as \u201cthe new Jim Crow.\u201d We haven\u2019t even gotten to the part where a National Guard officer mounts a cannon dressed only in his Confederate flag-emblazoned skivvies. Lee wrote \u201cChi-Raq\u201d with Kevin Willmott, whose wildly imaginative and similarly uneven satire <span>\u201cC.S.A.: The Confederate States of America\u201d recast political history as if the South had won the Civil War. Unleashed here, Willmot\u2019s sensibility veers daringly, if occasionally unsteadily, between the stirring and the silly. There are a few corny, too-obvious moments, such as a simpering appearance by a character named Oedipus, and a neighborhood cafe conveniently called the Deus Ex Machina. But within the movie\u2019s heightened theatricality and stylization, there are moments of inspired lunacy and outright brilliance: As Dolmedes, the one-man Greek chorus, Samuel L. Jackson provides a running commentary that is as sharply observant as it is profanely unprintable; and even though she\u2019s given a role in which she\u2019s unforgivably not asked to sing, Hudson conveys shattering depths of sorrow that Lee never loses sight of, even at his absurdist heights. (\u201cKeep Loving Each Other,\u201d reads one of several graffiti messages that serve as another kind of chorus.)</span> One of the most potent moments in \u201cChi-Raq\u201d is when Lee quotes \u201cThe Great Train Robbery\u201d to illustrate the dilemma of black communities caught between gangs and violent over-policing. He references other movies as well, including \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d and \u201cPatton.\u201d He also makes use of a few of his own signature flourishes, including his calling-card dolly shot. (\u201cChi-Raq\u201d has been vibrantly photographed by Matthew Libatique.) The film is such a grab bag of images, moods and tones that, if you find Bassett\u2019s showdown with a predatory insurance agent unconvincing, you can wait around for a cleverly choreographed dance set to the Chi-Lites during \u201cOperation Slow Jam,\u201d designed to weaken the women\u2019s resolve. The through-line of \u201cChi-Raq\u201d is a sense of crisis that Lee refuses to reduce to binary causes, but interprets in terms of history, economics and psychology, as well as the personal, political and spiritual. It\u2019s a lot to shoehorn into one movie, let alone one that traffics in the arcane narrative style of \u201cChi-Raq.\u201d But Lee is propelled by righteous anger that can\u2019t help but be infectious. Even at his most reckless, even outlandish, he\u2019s on the side of the angels. <b>R.</b>\u2009At area theaters.

His remarks about using government to attack companies and newspapers he doesn\u2019t like, and to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/26/donald-trump-vows-to-open-up-libel-laws-to-make-suing-the-media-easier-heres-how-he-could-do-it/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">change libel law</a> so that he can shut down criticism in the press, are genuinely un-American. They reflect an attitude toward using government power to target opponents that would be entirely familiar to people who live in Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s Russia or Chavista Venezuela. They have had no currency in Washington since the darkest, most paranoid days of Richard Nixon\u2019s enemies list. Mr. Trump directed his venom toward the New York Times, which he called \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cthe absolute worst,\u201d and to The Post and its owner, Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos. \u201cI have to tell you, I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he bought The Washington Post to have political influence,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That\u2019s not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems.

However, as the owner, he\u2019d be fully entitled to chart its ideological course if he wanted to, just as the owners of the Times, the Wall Street Journal and other great American newspapers do and have done for decades. The beauty of the American system is that it is a marketplace of ideas. News outlets compete for readers and viewers \u2014 not for government favor. Mr. Trump went on to say that as president he would \u201copen up the libel laws, so when they write purposefully negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.\u201d In fact, current law already allows public figures to sue for damages if the media write \u201cpurposefully\u201d false allegations. But the law makes public figures work harder to prove media recklessness than private citizens, who don\u2019t have to prove that a falsehood was malicious or intentional. That difference, established by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan\" title=\"en.wikipedia.org\">Supreme Court</a> more than a half century ago, has helped ensure the kind of lively political debate that Mr. Trump enjoys \u2014 except, apparently, when he is on the receiving end. Is Mr. Trump a threat to democracy? In history, it has generally been a mistake to laugh off the words of would-be dictators as they climbed to power. \u201cIf I become president, oh, do they have problems,\u201d Mr. Trump says.

He's just not going to do it this time. Instead, he's going to Congress to ask for permission he does not need. The ambivalence towards the president's war powers hasn't left anyone particularly happy. Advocates of a more restrained executive wish Obama had gone to Congress from the start, and gone to Congress for authorization to attack Libya, and they wish Obama would stop saying that he has the authority to strike even if Congress rejects his plans. As for those who want to see the president's war-making powers preserved and even stretched, they're furious for all the obvious reasons. But part of the danger is that President Obama's ambivalence towards the process on Syria appears to come from an ambivalence towards the policy on Syria. There is little enthusiasm inside the Obama administration for this strike, which is being carried out almost entirely for reasons of \"credibility\" and serves no larger purpose in protecting civilians or ending the conflict (indeed, it might <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/31/could-bombing-syria-kill-more-civilians-than-it-saves/\">make matters on-the-ground worse</a>). Which isn't to say the White House isn't aggressively lobbying for Congress's imprimatur. Obama's been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/middleeast/syria.html\">personally pushing</a> key lawmakers, and on Monday, secured the (tentative, conditional) support of Sen. John McCain. But the sum result of the president's approach has been to sow confusion on and off the Hill. It appears to many in Congress that Obama has come to them less to receive their blessing than to spread the blame for an intervention he doesn't feel comfortable being solely responsible for. In this, the act of going to Congress -- or at least the way Obama went to Congress -- has weakened the case for going to war in Congress's eyes. The irony now is that just as the best reasons for striking Syria are abstract, so too are many of the best reasons for Congress to back the president. \"If the Congress does support the President, it will only be after we have openly faltered, and after having rushed forward before deciding on a course of delay,\" writes Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The President will have set a uniquely dangerous precedent by turning to Congress only after he appeared weak.\" But \"if the Congress does not support the President, or should split openly in front of the world, the message will be far worse. A bad set of signals to the world will become a near disaster. Doubts about the U.S. and this President will reach dangerous levels among both friend and foe, and our failure to deal with Syria will spillover into Asia, the Afghan conflict, Iran, and any effort to bring an Arab-Israel peace.\" This, however, piles abstraction upon abstraction. President Obama feels the need to enter Syria not to solve a terrible conflict but to protect America's credibility and enforce international norms against chemical weapons. Congress might vote to enter Syria not because they believe the strikes make strategic or moral sense but because they feel the need to protect the president's credibility and quiet international doubts about the role America intends to play in the world going forward. Missing on all counts is a strong belief that striking Syria is, on its own merits, a good idea. <em></em><strong>Wonkbook's Number of the Day: 23. </strong>That, according to a <em>Washington Post </em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/02/where-the-votes-stand-on-syria/?wprss=rss_politics&clsrd\">tally</a>, is the current number of U.S. senators who have stated publicly that they favor a strike on Syria. 20 have said they do not. <strong>Wonkbook's Graph of the Day: </strong><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/01/these-two-maps-are-incredibly-important-to-obamacare/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein&clsrd\">These two maps are incredibly important to Obamacare</a>.<em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/01/this-graph-calls-the-entire-economic-recovery-into-question/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein&clsrd\"><br /> </a></em> <strong>Wonkbook's Top 5 Stories:</strong> 1) Syria resolution in the works; 2) how is Labor doing; 3) the NSA is outdone; 4) the price of carbon; and 5) what they say on the border about immigration reform. <strong>1) Top story: Your full top-of-the-week briefing on Syria<br /> </strong> <strong>New Syria plan in Senate limits Obama. </strong>\"Aides to Reid and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) have set aside a proposed Syria resolution submitted by the White House on Saturday night.

En route to that era, however, Bezos cited a challenge or two. One of them is the tendency of other Web sites to aggregate the hard labor of Washington Post journalism For such a technology-steeped entrepreneur, Bezos\u2019s remarks sound \u201cold-school,\u201d notes Steve Buttry, digital transformation editor for Digital First Media and Journal Register Co. \u201cIf you produce good content, people are going to repeat it,\u201d writes Buttry via e-mail, noting that the practice of summarizing the work of other outlets dates back quite a while. TV stations, for instance: What ever would they do if all of a sudden newspapers perished? They\u2019ve been re-reporting the work of newspapers for ages! \u201cAggregators who do that online at least link to us and send us traffic,\u201d argues Buttry. Arianna Huffington would agree. When asked at a 2009 forum how many people click from the Huffington Post\u2019s aggregated stories to the original reporting, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20090528/d7-interview-arianna-huffington-and-katharine-weymouth/\">she responded</a>, \u201cThe majority of people go to the original story.\u201d The Erik Wemple Blog would like to see the data to back up that assertion. This duality between originality and aggregation, however, has become all but obsolete on the newsy Internet. While The Washington Post does indeed heave a tremendous amount of original and industrious content every single day, it\u2019s not exactly allergic to aggregation. Think about the summer\u2019s blockbuster stories on privacy and the National Security Agency: The Post originated some of that reporting and watched as others \u2014 most notably the Guardian \u2014 debuted other huge chunks of it. On the stories that it didn\u2019t break, The Post scrambled to \u201cmatch\u201d \u2014 a newsperson\u2019s old-fashioned synonym for aggregating \u2014 and, hopefully, advance the reporting. The Erik Wemple Blog is having trouble thinking of a serious news outlet that doesn\u2019t do both of these things \u2014 original reporting as well as aggregating. Notes Jim Brady, editor in chief of Digital First Media, \u201cPretty much every news organization does its fair share of aggregation these days. \u2026 Yes, there are news organizations that get haughty and mad when someone aggregates their original work. But, in just about every case, that same news organization aggregates other people\u2019s work.\u201d (Disclosure: Buttry and Brady were former colleagues of the Erik Wemple Blog at now-defunct TBD.com) In a session this afternoon with Washington Post staffers, Bezos dug deeper on the Internet-sharing dynamic. To illustrate his point, he brought up the example of Business Insider, the prolifically aggregational site run by Henry Blodget \u2014 \u201chonestly a fantastic guy,\u201d noted Bezos. Blodget and his cohort, said Bezos, can read a piece of Washington Post enterprise journalism and, in \u201c20 minutes,\u201d kick out a rewrite with hot fudge and a cherry on top. For example: \u201cThey can make it more interesting by being meaner,\u201d noted Bezos, who is an investor in Business Insider. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d he said. So, what are the implications for The Post? \u201cWhat you have to do is figure out how to get back to that bundle,\u201d said the Amazon founder, who earlier in the day <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bezos-courts-washington-post-editors-reporters/2013/09/04/c863516e-156f-11e3-a2ec-b47e45e6f8ef_story.html\">told a group of Posties</a>, \u201cWe can\u2019t have people swooping in to read one article.\u201d Who knows where this strategic thinking leads? Perhaps The Post will become more creative about how it presents its stories, packaging its serious investigative stuff with more frivolous fare \u2014 a notion that Bezos contemplated in his town-hall appearance. Perhaps The Post will attempt to germinate a Business Insider subsidiary in its newsroom, though the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/elizabeth-flocks-resignation-the-post-fails-a-young-blogger/2012/04/20/gIQAFACXWT_story.html\">fate of blogPost</a>, the paper\u2019s former aggregation vehicle, suggests that might not work. And perhaps The Post will attempt to assert more web ownership of its enterprise stories, debuting them with accompanying blog posts and any little tricks to maximize hits to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\">washingtonpost.com</a>. Whatever the case, strategists should look to update their approach every day, because if there\u2019s one thing the Internet is doing, it\u2019s changing. BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith tells the Erik Wemple Blog that original content \u201cis the thing that goes big as the web shifts away from search and toward social.\u201d And Advertising Age\u2019s Simon Dumenco challenges Bezos\u2019s formulation about the ease of aggregation: \u201c[T]he truth is that real journalism, hard-hitting journalism, in-depth journalism about serious topics, isn\u2019t that easy to steal, briskly sum up and make click-worthy,\u201d notes Dumenco. \u201c[I]t\u2019s typically not hard-hitting stuff \u2014 it\u2019s ephemeral, fun (or fun-ish), generally pointless pop-cultural stuff that\u2019s getting heavily and widely aggregated.\u201d In other words, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/04/miley-cyrus-vmas-twerking-make-history\">Miley Cyrus</a> is a lot easier to aggregate than <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-budget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html\">the black budget</a>.

They say they expect to begin production of ethanol at <a href=\"http://poet-dsm.com/liberty\">the Emmetsburg plant </a>in early 2014, at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Not a moment too soon. For months, a brawl has been brewing in Washington over the future of ethanol plants like this one, pitting well-financed oil giants against trade groups and companies representing the politically well-connected biofuel industry. The heart of the dispute is the Energy Independence and Security Act passed by Congress in 2007 with rare bipartisan support. The law provided a road map for increasing the use of renewable agricultural byproducts in the U.S. motor fuel supply. The Poet plant is just what Congress envisioned, a Middle America biofuel displacing Middle East crude \u2014 with some possible climate benefits to boot. Corn-based ethanol, which makes up nearly 10 percent of U.S. motor fuel, has been in large-scale production for years. But Congress was worried about driving up the price of corn used as feed for livestock and poultry. So lawmakers capped the total production of corn-based ethanol and set a schedule for ramping up the use of \u201cadvanced\u201d biofuels made from corn husks, switch grass, wood chips and other stuff known as \u201ccellulosic\u201d material to 16 billion gallons by 2022. There\u2019s one problem, though: So far, no company has produced cellulosic ethanol at commercial volumes. Congress assumed that it could be phased in gradually, but not this gradually. This year refiners were supposed to mix about <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=12531\">one billion gallons </a>of it into motor fuel. So far, there has been hardly a drop. More than a dozen companies have tried and failed to find a profitable formula combining sophisticated enzymes and the mundane but costly and labor-intensive job of collecting biomass. Congress had the foresight to provide a safety valve. The Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the 2007 law, slashed the cellulosic ethanol quota this year, first to a paltry 14 million gallons and then again to 6 million, equal to about 0.004 percent of the fuel consumed by U.S. automobiles. It also extended the deadline for compliance. The EPA is widely expected to announce minimal quotas for next year soon, too. Oil industry lobbyists believe the EPA will also, for the first time, trim the minimum quotas for corn-based ethanol, angering farm interests and big corn-ethanol producers. The shortfall in cellulosic ethanol output has helped trigger high costs for some oil refiners under an arcane enforcement scheme that has the oil industry screaming \u2014 and lobbying \u2014 for congressional and regulatory relief. Ashley M. Smith, vice president for investor relations for Valero, the nation\u2019s biggest oil refiner, said during <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/1784022-valero-energy-management-discusses-q3-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\">an Oct. 29 conference call </a>with analysts that the company expects to spend $500 million to $600 million this year to buy certificates to comply with the program. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry, says that petroleum refiners shouldn\u2019t have to wait for the EPA to amend the targets every year. It wants the mandates \u2014 known as the Renewable Fuel Standard \u2014 abolished so that refiners don\u2019t pay penalties for failing to comply. The API has wallpapered billboards, Web sites and subway systems with ads. It has lobbied key members of Congress. And it has filed a lawsuit against what it called an \u201cunrealistic mandate.\u201d \u201cOur bottom line is that the RFS must be stopped once and for all,\u201d said Bob Greco, API\u2019s director of upstream and industry operations. He said the standard was \u201csimply broken.\u201d William R. Klesse, chief executive of Valero, which is also the nation\u2019s third-largest cornethanol producer, wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in September saying that cellulosic ethanol \u201cis still basically nonexistent with only small volumes expected.\u201d He said Congress \u201cshould develop an alternate RFS that encourages the development of the business, but also represents the real world.\u201d The ethanol industry has fired back that the oil companies\u2019s real agenda is to prevent a new industry from competing for space in American fuel tanks. They charge that oil firms fear losing even a 1 percent share of the roughly $450 billion-a-year gasoline market, especially since U.S. gasoline consumption <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=C100000001&f=A\">peaked in </a>2005 and has been falling as a result of higher fuel-efficiency standards for new American cars. \u201cWe would never have invested the amount of money we\u2019ve done without a clear framework like the one the RFS is providing. It is absolutely critical,\u201d said Manuel S\u00e1nchez Ortega, the chief executive of Spanish engineering giant Abengoa, which is finishing a cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kan. Repealing the RFS, he added, \u201cwould be somehow misleading to the investment community.\u201d Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is one target of lobbying groups. The goals set by Congress in 2007 were \u201cjust too aggressive,\u201d he said during a September meeting with reporters organized by Platts, an energy newsletter. But, he added, \u201cthere are people who\u2019ve made major investments. You\u2019re talking billions of dollars. <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> So what kind of signal are you sending\u201d by changing the RFS? \u201cThat kind of scares me,\u201d he said. The fight is coming to a head just as the first well-financed, truly commercial-size cellulosic ethanol plants are poised to come onstream. These ventures, while behind schedule, aren\u2019t start-ups, and the companies behind them have the financial muscle to push ahead. Dupont is close to completing <a href=\"http://biofuels.dupont.com/cellulosic-ethanol/nevada-site-ce-facility/\">a plant in the town of Nevada, Iowa,</a> that will produce 30 million gallons a year. <a href=\"http://www.abengoa.com/web/en/compania/index.html\">Abengoa</a>, the Spanish multinational energy, engineering and construction firm with more than 22,000 employees worldwide, says its Kansas plant will start up by early next year and produce 25 million gallons a year. It has been signing 10-year contracts with farmers within a 50-mile radius to buy biomass. Poet and DSM expect to begin production in <a href=\"http://poet-dsm.com/liberty\">Emmetsburg </a>in early 2014 at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Poet, which is the country\u2019s biggest corn-based ethanol producer, has worked on cellulosic technology since 2001. The plant is located next to a Poet corn-ethanol plant, so that it can draw on the same farmers for raw material. \u201cYou\u2019ve got $1 billion plus of investment in steel, and people don\u2019t put that kind of money in just for fun,\u201d said Adam Monroe, president of Novozymes America, the subsidiary of a Danish company that makes enzymes used to convert plants into sugars and then ethanol. \u201cThat first wave is coming online. It\u2019s been delayed, but many companies have experienced this in the economy we\u2019ve had in the past five years. I\u2019ve given my opinion to the guys up on the Hill: The standard has delivered the objectives of developing the fuel and the technology.\u201d Even with the opening of those three plants, U.S. cellulosic ethanol output will be minuscule compared with the ocean of gasoline American cars use. Altogether, they would produce about 4,900 barrels a day \u2014 or less than 0.06 percent of U.S. consumption. But the companies building those facilities say that they could replicate them and ultimately capture about 10 percent of the U.S. motor fuel market. \u201cThere is no question that there is a delay and therefore we expect the EPA to adapt the targets to the real production capacity of the industry,\u201d said Ortega, the Abengoa CEO. But he said abolishing the standard would be a mistake. \u201cThis is a huge change for the next 200 years. Two or three years delay \u2014 that\u2019s nothing,\u201d he added. \u201cTen years from now, when you look back, no one going to remember whether the industry took two or three more years to get to commercial scale. It\u2019s like asking when the airplane industry came to scale. You might get the decade but not the year.\u201d To reach the ethanol goals set by Congress, the government came up with a byzantine implementation plan. Each gallon of renewable fuel has its own 38-character number, called a \u201crenewable identification number,\u201d to track its use and monitor trading. There are different types of these RINs for different biofuels, including corn-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. In February of each year, refiners who fail to provide enough renewable fuel to the blenders who mix ethanol and gasoline must buy extra RIN certificates. When companies have extra credits for renewable fuels, the RINs can be banked and sold in later years. If there are not enough renewable fuels overall, the price of RINs rises \u2014 and provides an incentive to produce more. Normally, the RIN market is sleepy, with certificates selling for a few pennies a gallon. But earlier this year, uncertainty about whether the EPA would scale back the production targets and an element of speculation by traders at financial institutions combined to drive up the price of RINs to about $1.40 a gallon in July. Industry sources say that Morgan Stanley and energy trading firm Vitol took positions by buying and selling RINs. Suddenly, some refiners desperately needed RINs \u2014 and paid dearly for them. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t consider that an investment,\u201d Bill Day, a Valero spokesman, said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cost of compliance. It has no benefit, except if you\u2019re the one who made a lot of money off of the RINs.\u201d Oil refiners say the RIN system also punishes consumers. \u201cIt has affected gasoline prices at the pump,\u201d Day said, though the amounts tend to be modest. At $1 a gallon, and with ethanol making up a tenth of motor fuel volumes, that would add a dime to the cost of gasoline for as long as the high RIN prices persist. After the EPA changed the targets again in August, the RIN prices tumbled closer to their usual levels. The system has been subject to fraud. Last year, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Rodney Hailey of Clean Green Fuel was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/md-man-convicted-in-biodiesel-scam/2012/06/25/gJQA1q3j2V_story.html\">convicted</a> of selling $9 million of fake biofuel RINs to oil companies, brokers and producers. The refiner Tesoro allegedly used 861,000 invalid RINs, the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/resources/novs/civil/caa/fuel/tesoro.pdf\">EPA said</a> . Hailey\u2019s attorney said the brokers knew what he was up to. Hailey used the money to rent private planes, buy jewelry and More than a dozen luxury cars. Boosting the use of ethanol in motor fuel faces another obstacle: the \u201cblend wall.\u201d Oil industry executives say that ethanol should not make up any more than 10 percent of every gallon of motor fuel sold. The API says that motor fuel with 15 or 20 percent ethanol levels might damage vehicle engines and wouldn\u2019t be covered by automakers\u2019 warranties. Moreover, oil companies don\u2019t want to pay for new pumps at gas stations, most of which are independently owned.<b> </b> Ford Motor Co., which is developing cars capable of handling high levels of ethanol, <a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/environment-products-plan-migration-biofuel\">warns on its Web site </a>that \u201cethanol blends above E10 <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> may damage engines that are not designed to operate on higher concentrations of ethanol; this poses a particular concern for older vehicles.\u201d Supporters of biofuels say that, when it comes to cars, the API is relying on the results of limited studies, such as one by the Coordinating Research Council, a group supported by the oil and auto industries. It looked at eight cars, three of which suffered engine problems. The Energy Department called the study <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/getting-it-right-accurate-testing-and-assessments-critical-deploying-next-generation-auto\">\u201cseriously flawed\u201d</a> because, among other things, it subjected engine parts to unusually severe stress. The Energy Department\u2019s own study, based on 86 cars and four types of fuel, found no damage from the higher ethanol levels. The department said its tests \u201cshowed no statistically significant loss of vehicle performance (emissions, fuel economy, and maintenance issues) attributable to the use of E15 fuel compared to straight gasoline.\u201d It called the industry study \u201cunreliable and incomplete.\u201d An <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/55778.pdf\">earlier Energy Department test </a>of 2009 model cars also showed no effects from higher ethanol levels. The EPA has approved the use of fuel with 15 percent ethanol, but only for cars manufactured after 2001. E85, with 85 percent ethanol, can be used by flex-fuel cars, which make up a small portion of the nation\u2019s cars, mostly in the Midwest. In order to absorb the final congressional targets for ethanol use, ethanol will need to make up 20 percent or more of motor fuel. Higher volumes of ethanol have other challenges. Ethanol absorbs water, which can <a href=\"http://www.agmrc.org/media/cms/ksupipelineethl_8BA5CDF1FD179.pdf\">contribute to pipeline corrosion</a>, so companies usually transport ethanol by truck or rail and the blending of ethanol and gasoline takes place at distribution terminals close to gas stations. Ethanol also has two-thirds of the energy content of gasoline, so increasing the portion of ethanol reduces the miles per gallon slightly. The API also says that high ethanol fuel would damage gasoline-fired lawn mowers, leaf blowers and chain saws. But Hugh Welsh, president and general counsel of DSM North America, countered, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t make U.S. energy policy according to what\u2019s good for chain saws.\u201d In July, the API launched an aggressive \u201cfuel for thought\u201d print, radio and television campaign to rally public support to kill the Renewable Fuel Standard. It paid for a study by NERA, an economic consulting firm, which used the phrase \u201cdeath spiral\u201d a dozen times in a report, saying the standard \u201cin its current form\u201d could jack up diesel fuel prices threefold and raise gasoline prices 30 percent. The group\u2019s ads were placed in the District but also in the states and districts of lawmakers targeted by the API, an effort to prod constituents into pressuring their representatives. One shows a photo of a woman in a grocery store holding up her receipt above the words: \u201cDiverting crops from food to fuel? We\u2019re the ones who pay the price.\u201d \u201cBattle ads are running not only here but in some parts of the country,\u201d Shimkus said, adding that \u201cit does not make for good negotiations when you\u2019re getting pummeled.\u201d Oil industry lobbyists say they still hope for legislative change, if not repeal. One outcome the lobbyists have explored: keep the 10 percent limit on ethanol, trim the corn\u2019s share and increase the cellulosic quota. Because cellulosic ethanol\u2019s level of greenhouse gas emissions is lower than corn ethanol\u2019s, the oil lobbyists hope they can make common cause with some liberal lawmakers concerned about the climate. The farm lobby remains a potent force in favor of leaving the fuel standard alone. The ethanol business has provided new markets and more demand for corn. \u201cThere is no need for Congress to intervene in this,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a speech in September. \u201cThere is no need for Congress to try to rewrite this renewable-fuels standard. They got it right the first time.\u201d Refiners bristle over that. \u201cThe only one this is working for is the corn growers in Iowa, but that\u2019s not why we created this program,\u201d said Stephen H. Brown, vice president for government affairs at Tesoro. \u201cThe idea was not to lift all boats in Iowa. The idea behind this was not a Marshall Plan for the Midwest.\u201d Many refiners also want Congress to restructure the enforcement system. In a Jan. 25 unanimous ruling on a case brought by the API, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href=\"http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/A57AB46B228054BD85257AFE00556B45/$file/12-1139-1417101.pdf\">wrote</a> that the RIN system punishes refiners for biofuel producers\u2019 failings. \u201cApart from their role as captive consumers, the refiners are in no position to ensure, or even contribute to, growth in the cellulosic biofuel industry. \u2018Do a good job, cellulosic fuel producers. If you fail, we\u2019ll fine your customers,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 the court wrote. \u201cGiven this asymmetry in incentives, EPA\u2019s projection is not \u2018technology-forcing\u2019 in the same sense as other innovation-minded regulations that we have upheld.\u201d While the court upheld the EPA\u2019s power to issue waivers or independently calculate reasonable renewable-fuel requirements, it faulted the agency for leaning toward setting targets higher than actual output in an effort to stimulate new production. The ruling said the agency should not \u201clet its aspirations for a self-fulfilling prophecy divert it from a neutral methodology.\u201d But the view from Iowa is that the prophecy is starting to be fulfilled, albeit slowly. DSM\u2019s Welsh said \u201cthe idea that this is some kind of phantom fuel is evaporating. And that\u2019s why there is so much rhetoric from the oil industry. Every drop of ethanol that replaces a drop of gasoline costs them money. But without the mandate, there\u2019d be no industry.\u201d The \u201cnow hiring\u201d sign is up online for Emmetsburg, Iowa, where the nation\u2019s largest maker of ethanol used for motor fuel is putting the final touches on a manufacturing plant that will rely not on corn, but on the stalks and cobs left behind. The company, Poet, is looking for an accountant, electricians, lab technicians, a supervisor for starch and cellulose operations, and more.

Klesse, chief executive of Valero, which is also the nation\u2019s third-largest cornethanol producer, wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in September saying that cellulosic ethanol \u201cis still basically nonexistent with only small volumes expected.\u201d He said Congress \u201cshould develop an alternate RFS that encourages the development of the business, but also represents the real world.\u201d The ethanol industry has fired back that the oil companies\u2019s real agenda is to prevent a new industry from competing for space in American fuel tanks. They charge that oil firms fear losing even a 1 percent share of the roughly $450 billion-a-year gasoline market, especially since U.S. gasoline consumption <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=C100000001&f=A\">peaked in </a>2005 and has been falling as a result of higher fuel-efficiency standards for new American cars. \u201cWe would never have invested the amount of money we\u2019ve done without a clear framework like the one the RFS is providing. It is absolutely critical,\u201d said Manuel S\u00e1nchez Ortega, the chief executive of Spanish engineering giant Abengoa, which is finishing a cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kan. Repealing the RFS, he added, \u201cwould be somehow misleading to the investment community.\u201d Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is one target of lobbying groups. The goals set by Congress in 2007 were \u201cjust too aggressive,\u201d he said during a September meeting with reporters organized by Platts, an energy newsletter. But, he added, \u201cthere are people who\u2019ve made major investments. You\u2019re talking billions of dollars. <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> So what kind of signal are you sending\u201d by changing the RFS? \u201cThat kind of scares me,\u201d he said. The fight is coming to a head just as the first well-financed, truly commercial-size cellulosic ethanol plants are poised to come onstream. These ventures, while behind schedule, aren\u2019t start-ups, and the companies behind them have the financial muscle to push ahead. Dupont is close to completing <a href=\"http://biofuels.dupont.com/cellulosic-ethanol/nevada-site-ce-facility/\">a plant in the town of Nevada, Iowa,</a> that will produce 30 million gallons a year. <a href=\"http://www.abengoa.com/web/en/compania/index.html\">Abengoa</a>, the Spanish multinational energy, engineering and construction firm with more than 22,000 employees worldwide, says its Kansas plant will start up by early next year and produce 25 million gallons a year. It has been signing 10-year contracts with farmers within a 50-mile radius to buy biomass. Poet and DSM expect to begin production in <a href=\"http://poet-dsm.com/liberty\">Emmetsburg </a>in early 2014 at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Poet, which is the country\u2019s biggest corn-based ethanol producer, has worked on cellulosic technology since 2001. The plant is located next to a Poet corn-ethanol plant, so that it can draw on the same farmers for raw material. \u201cYou\u2019ve got $1 billion plus of investment in steel, and people don\u2019t put that kind of money in just for fun,\u201d said Adam Monroe, president of Novozymes America, the subsidiary of a Danish company that makes enzymes used to convert plants into sugars and then ethanol. \u201cThat first wave is coming online. It\u2019s been delayed, but many companies have experienced this in the economy we\u2019ve had in the past five years. I\u2019ve given my opinion to the guys up on the Hill: The standard has delivered the objectives of developing the fuel and the technology.\u201d Even with the opening of those three plants, U.S. cellulosic ethanol output will be minuscule compared with the ocean of gasoline American cars use. Altogether, they would produce about 4,900 barrels a day \u2014 or less than 0.06 percent of U.S. consumption. But the companies building those facilities say that they could replicate them and ultimately capture about 10 percent of the U.S. motor fuel market. \u201cThere is no question that there is a delay and therefore we expect the EPA to adapt the targets to the real production capacity of the industry,\u201d said Ortega, the Abengoa CEO. But he said abolishing the standard would be a mistake. \u201cThis is a huge change for the next 200 years. Two or three years delay \u2014 that\u2019s nothing,\u201d he added. \u201cTen years from now, when you look back, no one going to remember whether the industry took two or three more years to get to commercial scale. It\u2019s like asking when the airplane industry came to scale. You might get the decade but not the year.\u201d To reach the ethanol goals set by Congress, the government came up with a byzantine implementation plan. Each gallon of renewable fuel has its own 38-character number, called a \u201crenewable identification number,\u201d to track its use and monitor trading. There are different types of these RINs for different biofuels, including corn-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. In February of each year, refiners who fail to provide enough renewable fuel to the blenders who mix ethanol and gasoline must buy extra RIN certificates. When companies have extra credits for renewable fuels, the RINs can be banked and sold in later years. If there are not enough renewable fuels overall, the price of RINs rises \u2014 and provides an incentive to produce more. Normally, the RIN market is sleepy, with certificates selling for a few pennies a gallon. But earlier this year, uncertainty about whether the EPA would scale back the production targets and an element of speculation by traders at financial institutions combined to drive up the price of RINs to about $1.40 a gallon in July. Industry sources say that Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and energy trading firm Vitol all took positions by buying and selling RINs. Suddenly, some refiners desperately needed RINs \u2014 and paid dearly for them. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t consider that an investment,\u201d Bill Day, a Valero spokesman, said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cost of compliance. It has no benefit, except if you\u2019re the one who made a lot of money off of the RINs.\u201d Oil refiners say the RIN system also punishes consumers. \u201cIt has affected gasoline prices at the pump,\u201d Day said, though the amounts tend to be modest. At $1 a gallon, and with ethanol making up a tenth of motor fuel volumes, that would add a dime to the cost of gasoline for as long as the high RIN prices persist. After the EPA changed the targets again in August, the RIN prices tumbled closer to their usual levels. The system has been subject to fraud. Last year, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Rodney Hailey of Clean Green Fuel was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/md-man-convicted-in-biodiesel-scam/2012/06/25/gJQA1q3j2V_story.html\">convicted</a> of selling $9 million of fake biofuel RINs to oil companies, brokers and producers. The refiner Tesoro allegedly used 861,000 invalid RINs, the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/resources/novs/civil/caa/fuel/tesoro.pdf\">EPA said</a> . Hailey\u2019s attorney said the brokers knew what he was up to. Hailey used the money to rent private planes, buy jewelry and More than a dozen luxury cars. Boosting the use of ethanol in motor fuel faces another obstacle: the \u201cblend wall.\u201d Oil industry executives say that ethanol should not make up any more than 10 percent of every gallon of motor fuel sold. The API says that motor fuel with 15 or 20 percent ethanol levels might damage vehicle engines and wouldn\u2019t be covered by automakers\u2019 warranties. Moreover, oil companies don\u2019t want to pay for new pumps at gas stations, most of which are independently owned.<b> </b> Ford Motor Co., which is developing cars capable of handling high levels of ethanol, <a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/environment-products-plan-migration-biofuel\">warns on its Web site </a>that \u201cethanol blends above E10 <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> may damage engines that are not designed to operate on higher concentrations of ethanol; this poses a particular concern for older vehicles.\u201d Supporters of biofuels say that, when it comes to cars, the API is relying on the results of limited studies, such as one by the Coordinating Research Council, a group supported by the oil and auto industries. It looked at eight cars, three of which suffered engine problems. The Energy Department called the study <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/getting-it-right-accurate-testing-and-assessments-critical-deploying-next-generation-auto\">\u201cseriously flawed\u201d</a> because, among other things, it subjected engine parts to unusually severe stress. The Energy Department\u2019s own study, based on 86 cars and four types of fuel, found no damage from the higher ethanol levels. The department said its tests \u201cshowed no statistically significant loss of vehicle performance (emissions, fuel economy, and maintenance issues) attributable to the use of E15 fuel compared to straight gasoline.\u201d It called the industry study \u201cunreliable and incomplete.\u201d An <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/55778.pdf\">earlier Energy Department test </a>of 2009 model cars also showed no effects from higher ethanol levels. The EPA has approved the use of fuel with 15 percent ethanol, but only for cars manufactured after 2001. E85, with 85 percent ethanol, can be used by flex-fuel cars, which make up a small portion of the nation\u2019s cars, mostly in the Midwest. In order to absorb the final congressional targets for ethanol use, ethanol will need to make up 20 percent or more of motor fuel. Higher volumes of ethanol have other challenges. Ethanol absorbs water, which can <a href=\"http://www.agmrc.org/media/cms/ksupipelineethl_8BA5CDF1FD179.pdf\">contribute to pipeline corrosion</a>, so companies usually transport ethanol by truck or rail and the blending of ethanol and gasoline takes place at distribution terminals close to gas stations. Ethanol also has two-thirds of the energy content of gasoline, so increasing the portion of ethanol reduces the miles per gallon slightly. The API also says that high ethanol fuel would damage gasoline-fired lawn mowers, leaf blowers and chain saws. But Hugh Welsh, president and general counsel of DSM North America, countered, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t make U.S. energy policy according to what\u2019s good for chain saws.\u201d In July, the API launched an aggressive \u201cfuel for thought\u201d print, radio and television campaign to rally public support to kill the Renewable Fuel Standard. It paid for a study by NERA, an economic consulting firm, which used the phrase \u201cdeath spiral\u201d a dozen times in a report, saying the standard \u201cin its current form\u201d could jack up diesel fuel prices threefold and raise gasoline prices 30 percent. The group\u2019s ads were placed in the District but also in the states and districts of lawmakers targeted by the API, an effort to prod constituents into pressuring their representatives. One shows a photo of a woman in a grocery store holding up her receipt above the words: \u201cDiverting crops from food to fuel? We\u2019re the ones who pay the price.\u201d \u201cBattle ads are running not only here but in some parts of the country,\u201d Shimkus said, adding that \u201cit does not make for good negotiations when you\u2019re getting pummeled.\u201d Oil industry lobbyists say they still hope for legislative change, if not repeal. One outcome the lobbyists have explored: keep the 10 percent limit on ethanol, trim the corn\u2019s share and increase the cellulosic quota. Because cellulosic ethanol\u2019s level of greenhouse gas emissions is lower than corn ethanol\u2019s, the oil lobbyists hope they can make common cause with some liberal lawmakers concerned about the climate. The farm lobby remains a potent force in favor of leaving the fuel standard alone. The ethanol business has provided new markets and more demand for corn. \u201cThere is no need for Congress to intervene in this,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a speech in September. \u201cThere is no need for Congress to try to rewrite this renewable-fuels standard. They got it right the first time.\u201d Refiners bristle over that. \u201cThe only one this is working for is the corn growers in Iowa, but that\u2019s not why we created this program,\u201d said Stephen H. Brown, vice president for government affairs at Tesoro. \u201cThe idea was not to lift all boats in Iowa. The idea behind this was not a Marshall Plan for the Midwest.\u201d Many refiners also want Congress to restructure the enforcement system. In a Jan. 25 unanimous ruling on a case brought by the API, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href=\"http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/A57AB46B228054BD85257AFE00556B45/$file/12-1139-1417101.pdf\">wrote</a> that the RIN system punishes refiners for biofuel producers\u2019 failings. \u201cApart from their role as captive consumers, the refiners are in no position to ensure, or even contribute to, growth in the cellulosic biofuel industry. \u2018Do a good job, cellulosic fuel producers. If you fail, we\u2019ll fine your customers,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 the court wrote. \u201cGiven this asymmetry in incentives, EPA\u2019s projection is not \u2018technology-forcing\u2019 in the same sense as other innovation-minded regulations that we have upheld.\u201d While the court upheld the EPA\u2019s power to issue waivers or independently calculate reasonable renewable-fuel requirements, it faulted the agency for leaning toward setting targets higher than actual output in an effort to stimulate new production. The ruling said the agency should not \u201clet its aspirations for a self-fulfilling prophecy divert it from a neutral methodology.\u201d But the view from Iowa is that the prophecy is starting to be fulfilled, albeit slowly. DSM\u2019s Welsh said \u201cthe idea that this is some kind of phantom fuel is evaporating. And that\u2019s why there is so much rhetoric from the oil industry. Every drop of ethanol that replaces a drop of gasoline costs them money. But without the mandate, there\u2019d be no industry.\u201d The \u201cnow hiring\u201d sign is up online for Emmetsburg, Iowa, where the nation\u2019s largest maker of ethanol used for motor fuel is putting the final touches on a manufacturing plant that will rely not on corn, but on the stalks and cobs left behind. The company, Poet, is looking for an accountant, electricians, lab technicians, a supervisor for starch and cellulose operations, and more. Large flatbed trucks have already <a href=\"http://poet.com/pr/farmers-now-harvesting-biomass-liberty\">dropped off </a>2,600 tons of big bales at the distillery\u2019s 22-acre stack yard. Equipment is visible from miles away across the flat, open prairie. The process is a bit like making moonshine on an industrial scale, helped along by some high-tech, bioengineered enzymes. \u201cMy gosh, it\u2019s been a boon for everybody,\u201d said Myrna Heddinger, a retired nurse serving her third term as the mayor of Emmetsburg, a town of 3,500 people that has squeezed in 500 temporary construction workers. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that many places for people to rent to stay,\u201d she added. Poet and its joint venture partner, the Dutch industrial giant and enzyme maker DSM, have <a href=\"http://poet-dsm.com/liberty\">received </a>$100 million in Energy Department grants and $20 million in financial incentives from the state of Iowa. They say they expect to begin production of ethanol at <a href=\"http://poet-dsm.com/liberty\">the Emmetsburg plant </a>in early 2014, at a rate of about 20 million gallons a year. Not a moment too soon. For months, a brawl has been brewing in Washington over the future of ethanol plants like this one, pitting well-financed oil giants against trade groups and companies representing the politically well-connected biofuel industry. The heart of the dispute is the Energy Independence and Security Act passed by Congress in 2007 with rare bipartisan support. The law provided a road map for increasing the use of renewable agricultural byproducts in the U.S. motor fuel supply. The Poet plant is just what Congress envisioned, a Middle America biofuel displacing Middle East crude \u2014 with some possible climate benefits to boot. Corn-based ethanol, which makes up nearly 10 percent of U.S. motor fuel, has been in large-scale production for years. But Congress was worried about driving up the price of corn used as feed for livestock and poultry. So lawmakers capped the total production of corn-based ethanol and set a schedule for ramping up the use of \u201cadvanced\u201d biofuels made from corn husks, switch grass, wood chips and other stuff known as \u201ccellulosic\u201d material to 16 billion gallons by 2022. There\u2019s one problem, though: So far, no company has produced cellulosic ethanol at commercial volumes. Congress assumed that it could be phased in gradually, but not this gradually. This year refiners were supposed to mix about <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=12531\">one billion gallons </a>of it into motor fuel. So far, there has been hardly a drop. More than a dozen companies have tried and failed to find a profitable formula combining sophisticated enzymes and the mundane but costly and labor-intensive job of collecting biomass. Congress had the foresight to provide a safety valve. The Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the 2007 law, slashed the cellulosic ethanol quota this year, first to a paltry 14 million gallons and then again to 6 million, equal to about 0.004 percent of the fuel consumed by U.S. automobiles. It also extended the deadline for compliance. The EPA is widely expected to announce minimal quotas for next year soon, too. Oil industry lobbyists believe the EPA will also, for the first time, trim the minimum quotas for corn-based ethanol, angering farm interests and big corn-ethanol producers. The shortfall in cellulosic ethanol output has helped trigger high costs for some oil refiners under an arcane enforcement scheme that has the oil industry screaming \u2014 and lobbying \u2014 for congressional and regulatory relief. Ashley M. Smith, vice president for investor relations for Valero, the nation\u2019s biggest oil refiner, said during <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/1784022-valero-energy-management-discusses-q3-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\">an Oct. 29 conference call </a>with analysts that the company expects to spend $500 million to $600 million this year to buy certificates to comply with the program. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry, says that petroleum refiners shouldn\u2019t have to wait for the EPA to amend the targets every year. It wants the mandates \u2014 known as the Renewable Fuel Standard \u2014 abolished so that refiners don\u2019t pay penalties for failing to comply. The API has wallpapered billboards, Web sites and subway systems with ads. It has lobbied key members of Congress. And it has filed a lawsuit against what it called an \u201cunrealistic mandate.\u201d \u201cOur bottom line is that the RFS must be stopped once and for all,\u201d said Bob Greco, API\u2019s director of upstream and industry operations.

In order to absorb the final congressional targets for ethanol use, ethanol will need to make up 20 percent or more of motor fuel. Higher volumes of ethanol have other challenges. Ethanol absorbs water, which can <a href=\"http://www.agmrc.org/media/cms/ksupipelineethl_8BA5CDF1FD179.pdf\">contribute to pipeline corrosion</a>, so companies usually transport ethanol by truck or rail and the blending of ethanol and gasoline takes place at distribution terminals close to gas stations. Ethanol also has two-thirds of the energy content of gasoline, so increasing the portion of ethanol reduces the miles per gallon slightly. The API also says that high ethanol fuel would damage gasoline-fired lawn mowers, leaf blowers and chain saws. But Hugh Welsh, president and general counsel of DSM North America, countered, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t make U.S. energy policy according to what\u2019s good for chain saws.\u201d In July, the API launched an aggressive \u201cfuel for thought\u201d print, radio and television campaign to rally public support to kill the Renewable Fuel Standard. It paid for a study by NERA, an economic consulting firm, which used the phrase \u201cdeath spiral\u201d a dozen times in a report, saying the standard \u201cin its current form\u201d could jack up diesel fuel prices threefold and raise gasoline prices 30 percent. The group\u2019s ads were placed in the District but also in the states and districts of lawmakers targeted by the API, an effort to prod constituents into pressuring their representatives. One shows a photo of a woman in a grocery store holding up her receipt above the words: \u201cDiverting crops from food to fuel? We\u2019re the ones who pay the price.\u201d \u201cBattle ads are running not only here but in some parts of the country,\u201d Shimkus said, adding that \u201cit does not make for good negotiations when you\u2019re getting pummeled.\u201d Oil industry lobbyists say they still hope for legislative change, if not repeal. One outcome the lobbyists have explored: keep the 10 percent limit on ethanol, trim the corn\u2019s share and increase the cellulosic quota. Because cellulosic ethanol\u2019s level of greenhouse gas emissions is lower than corn ethanol\u2019s, the oil lobbyists hope they can make common cause with some liberal lawmakers concerned about the climate. The farm lobby remains a potent force in favor of leaving the fuel standard alone. The ethanol business has provided new markets and more demand for corn. \u201cThere is no need for Congress to intervene in this,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a speech in September. \u201cThere is no need for Congress to try to rewrite this renewable-fuels standard. They got it right the first time.\u201d Refiners bristle over that. \u201cThe only one this is working for is the corn growers in Iowa, but that\u2019s not why we created this program,\u201d said Stephen H. Brown, vice president for government affairs at Tesoro. \u201cThe idea was not to lift all boats in Iowa. The idea behind this was not a Marshall Plan for the Midwest.\u201d Many refiners also want Congress to restructure the enforcement system. In a Jan. 25 unanimous ruling on a case brought by the API, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href=\"http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/A57AB46B228054BD85257AFE00556B45/$file/12-1139-1417101.pdf\">wrote</a> that the RIN system punishes refiners for biofuel producers\u2019 failings. \u201cApart from their role as captive consumers, the refiners are in no position to ensure, or even contribute to, growth in the cellulosic biofuel industry. \u2018Do a good job, cellulosic fuel producers. If you fail, we\u2019ll fine your customers,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 the court wrote. \u201cGiven this asymmetry in incentives, EPA\u2019s projection is not \u2018technology-forcing\u2019 in the same sense as other innovation-minded regulations that we have upheld.\u201d While the court upheld the EPA\u2019s power to issue waivers or independently calculate reasonable renewable-fuel requirements, it faulted the agency for leaning toward setting targets higher than actual output in an effort to stimulate new production. The ruling said the agency should not \u201clet its aspirations for a self-fulfilling prophecy divert it from a neutral methodology.\u201d But the view from Iowa is that the prophecy is starting to be fulfilled, albeit slowly. DSM\u2019s Welsh said \u201cthe idea that this is some kind of phantom fuel is evaporating. And that\u2019s why there is so much rhetoric from the oil industry. Every drop of ethanol that replaces a drop of gasoline costs them money. But without the mandate, there\u2019d be no industry.\u201d Related stories: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/why-hasnt-cellulosic-ethanol-taken-over-like-it-was-supposed-to/2013/11/08/b25b0d2c-466a-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html\">Why hasn\u2019t cellulosic ethanol taken over, like it was supposed to?</a> "}], "saliency": [{"id": 82510.0, "text": "Energy Department", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States Department of Energy", "entityid": 62866}, {"id": 82520.0, "text": "Baltimore", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Baltimore", "entityid": 26997138}, {"id": 82530.0, "text": "Dupont", "wiki_title": "enwiki:DuPont", "entityid": 201829}, {"id": 82540.0, "text": "Hugoton", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Hugoton, Kansas", "entityid": 114959}, {"id": 82550.0, "text": "Nevada", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Nevada, Iowa", "entityid": 24429959}, {"id": 82560.0, "text": "Tom Vilsack", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Tom Vilsack", "entityid": 99628}, {"id": 82570.0, "text": "Midwest", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Midwestern United States", "entityid": 104697}, {"id": 82580.0, "text": "America", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States", "entityid": 951976}, {"id": 82590.0, "text": "Gina McCarthy", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Gina McCarthy", "entityid": 38606210}, {"id": 82510.0, "text": "Goldman", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Goldman Sachs", "entityid": 335244}, {"id": 82511.0, "text": "Spanish", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Spain", "entityid": 26667}, {"id": 82512.0, "text": "Emmetsburg", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Emmetsburg, Iowa", "entityid": 114127}, {"id": 82513.0, "text": "Iowa", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Iowa", "entityid": 26810748}, {"id": 82514.0, "text": "EPA", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States Environmental Protection Agency", "entityid": 58666}, {"id": 82515.0, "text": "U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit", "entityid": 575245}, {"id": 82516.0, "text": "House Energy and Commerce Committee", "wiki_title": "enwiki:United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce", "entityid": 1635261}, {"id": 82517.0, "text": "District", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Washington, D.C.", "entityid": 108956}, {"id": 82518.0, "text": "Dutch", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Netherlands", "entityid": 21148}, {"id": 82519.0, "text": "API", "wiki_title": "enwiki:American Petroleum Institute", "entityid": 1691321}, {"id": 82520.0, "text": "Platts", "wiki_title": "enwiki:SANDP Global Platts", "entityid": 1691321}, {"id": 82521.0, "text": "Poet", "wiki_title": "enwiki:POET", "entityid": 20069528}, {"id": 82522.0, "text": "Vitol", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Vitol", "entityid": 17518274}, {"id": 82523.0, "text": "Morgan Stanley", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Morgan Stanley", "entityid": 74384}, {"id": 82524.0, "text": "Valero", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Valero Energy", "entityid": 306926}, {"id": 82525.0, "text": "Tesoro", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Andeavor", "entityid": 307042}, {"id": 82526.0, "text": "Shimkus", "wiki_title": "enwiki:John Shimkus", "entityid": 412158}, {"id": 82527.0, "text": "Kan.", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Kansas", "entityid": 16716}, {"id": 82528.0, "text": "DSM North America", "wiki_title": "enwiki:DSM (company)", "entityid": 1079743}, {"id": 82529.0, "text": "Middle East", "wiki_title": "enwiki:Middle East", "entityid": 19323}, {"id": 82530.0, "text": "William R.

Its vice president for business development said, \u201cIt\u2019s affordable, and it\u2019s now.\u201d</span> Now never came. Coskata never did make commercial volumes of ethanol made from raw cellulosic material such as corn stalks, switch grass, wood chips, municipal waste and other biomass. Last year, Coskata changed strategy \u2014 to use natural gas instead. In July this year, it backed out of a planned $100 million initial public offering. Coskata isn\u2019t alone. Five years ago, about a dozen companies were racing to start up distilleries that would produce enough cellulosic ethanol to meet the congressionally mandated target of 16 billion gallons a year by 2022. Venture capitalists such as Vinod Khosla, one of the co-founders of Sun Microsystems, vowed to bring their high-tech savvy to the energy business. And the federal government was often ready with grants, loans or loan guarantees. The Agriculture Department provided a $250 million loan guarantee for the Coskata plant. Today, most of the dozen contenders have gone out of business or shelved their plans. They have had trouble cutting the costs of enzymes, collecting the bulky raw materials and raising capital, especially in the economic slowdown. To oil executives, these firms\u2019 woes show that the makers of cellulosic ethanol have no place in the massive motor-fuel business. But some boosters of advanced biofuels remain undaunted. \u201cOne thing about technology is that there\u2019s always a win, place and show, and everyone else goes under,\u201d Khosla said. He said his firm has invested in half a dozen biofuel technologies. He has spread his bets, usually investing no more than $30 million at a time. The concept isn\u2019t complicated. Using enzymes, companies can convert cellulose in plants into ethanol. But coming up with a cocktail of enzymes that work quickly and efficiently and at large scale isn\u2019t so easy. Some corporations \u2014 among them Poet and DSM, Dupont, Abengoa and Ineos \u2014 say they will start commercial production by early next year. Other companies, however, have stumbled. In 2008, the Web site GigaOM.com, which reports about emerging technologies, said 11 companies were racing to complete cellulosic plants. Verenium was one. Later, strapped for cash, it was bought by BP, which by October 2012 scrapped plans for a cellulosic plant in Florida. A spokesman said BP would \u201credeploy the considerable capital required to build this facility into other more attractive projects.\u201d Range Fuels, another firm backed by Khosla, closed its Georgia wood-chip plant in late 2011, after getting $46.3 million of a $76 million Energy Department grant and half of an $80 million loan from the Agriculture Department, according to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-02/range-fuels-cellulosic-ethanol-plant-fails-as-u-s-pulls-plug.html\">a Bloomberg News report</a>. Mascoma was another contender in 2008. In August, Valero, the nation\u2019s biggest oil refiner, withdrew an offer to provide $50 million for a plant in Michigan, and in September, Mascoma dropped plans for a $100 million initial public offering. <a href=\"http://www.zeachem.com/press/pressrelease073113.php\">ZeaChem</a> laid off employees less than a month after starting up its plant in Boardman, Ore., and now produces insignificant quantities. BlueFire Renewables <a href=\"http://bfreinc.com/2013/10/bluefire-renewables-adds-new-revenue-source-to-fulton-facility/\">received an $88 million Energy Department grant</a> under the 2009 stimulus bill to produce 19 million gallons a year of ethanol from woody biomass and municipal waste in Fulton, Miss. Its <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1370489/000149315213001654/form10q.htm\">latest SEC filing</a> shows no revenue and virtually no cash. Its shares are worth less than a penny each. The roads and railroad ties in Fulton stand idle. Khosla\u2019s unabated enthusiasm has turned toward a company called Kior. In October, Khosla agreed to triple his investment to about $125 million. He says Kior, which would turn cellulosic materials into liquids identical to conventional diesel or gasoline, would be able to ship its products in existing pipelines. \u201cIt is exactly the same as what nature does, but nature takes a million years and we take a few minutes,\u201d Khosla said. <span>But Kior has had a rocky time. </span>It got off to an enthusiastic start. Condoleezza Rice was a director. Investors swooned, driving its market value up to $1.7 billion by October 2011 \u2014 long before the company had any revenue. It\u2019s now worth $250 million. In late 2012, Kior\u2019s chief executive predicted that its plant would churn out 14 million gallons this year. But on Aug. 8, Kior announced that it had shipped only 75,000 gallons in the second quarter. A group of investors <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20131011-911255.html\">filed suit ,</a>claiming the firm had \u201cmade false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> KiOR was not on track to produce commercially meaningful quantities of biofuel.\u201d On Thursday, Kior said it produced 323,841 gallons in the third quarter. Thanks to Khosla and a small investment by a Bill Gates venture capital fund, the company isn\u2019t dead yet. Khosla says that Kior can produce gasoline competitively now mostly because crude oil prices are $100 a barrel and the Renewable Fuel Standard mandates provide a cushion. But he says Kior\u2019s plants will get better and cheaper by the time the fifth or sixth is built. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, in a recent speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the nation is \u201con a path\u201d to $2.15 a-gallon cellulosic ethanol \u201ctoward the end of this decade.\u201d He said \u201cwe\u2019re getting into the ballpark <span>.\u2009.\u2009.</span> of being able to provide biofuels at a reasonably competitive cost.\u201d Related stories: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/cellulosic-ethanol-once-the-way-of-the-future-is-off-to-a-delayed-boisterous-start/2013/11/08/a1c41a70-35c7-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html\">Cellulosic ethanol, once the way of the future, is off to a delayed, boisterous start</a> "}], "saliency": []}

The proposal would set ethanol use at 15.21 billion gallons, just under 10 percent of motor-<br align=\"block\" />fuel consumption and 16 percent lower than targets established by Congress in 2007. It angered farm groups, corn-ethanol producers and supporters of biodiesel, but it mollified oil companies, which have long argued that if the content of ethanol in motor fuel exceeded 10 percent \u2014 known as the blend wall \u2014 it might damage cars, motorcycles and lawn mowers. Groups representing ethanol makers say that mixing higher levels of ethanol with gasoline would not harm vehicles. \u201cFacts are facts,\u201d said Stephen H. Brown, vice president for governmental affairs at the oil refiner Tesoro. \u201cThey\u2019re so stubborn even this administration has to accept them.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re capitulating to the oil companies,\u201d Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said of the administration. He said that the EPA\u2019s proposed targets would hurt farmers and violate the spirit of the renewable fuels standard Congress adopted. \u201cThe RFS was about forcing marketplace change,\u201d he said, \u201cand EPA is giving the oil companies a get-out-of-jail-free card.\u201d The EPA proposal, which includes target ranges for each kind of renewable fuel, will be subject to comment before the agency settles on quotas in the first quarter of 2014. The EPA quotas for biofuels are part of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/cellulosic-ethanol-once-the-way-of-the-future-is-off-to-a-delayed-boisterous-start/2013/11/08/a1c41a70-35c7-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html\">the renewable-fuel standards </a>established under energy legislation passed by Congress in 2007. Congress, eager to replace a portion of U.S. oil imports with homegrown fuel and to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions from transportation fuels, set a schedule that would phase in corn-based ethanol and later \u201ccellulosic\u201d ethanol, which is made from things other than corn, such as switchgrass, corn cobs, corn stalks, waste or wood chips. Congress also gave the EPA authority to alter the production targets if they proved unrealistic. The American Petroleum Institute has been lobbying to repeal the renewable-fuel standard altogether, and the EPA\u2019s proposed ranges did not entirely placate the group. API President Jack Gerard said that \u201cmore must be done\u201d and \u201cultimately Congress must protect consumers from this outdated and unworkable program.\u201d But some industry officials said that if the EPA sticks to the blend wall, they will be satisfied. Oil refiners need to mix nearly that much ethanol into motor fuel anyway to meet octane requirements. The new proposal is in line with numbers included in a leaked version last month. The midpoint of every range is the same as the earlier figures. The 15.21-billion-gallon ceiling the EPA set Friday for renewable fuels in 2014 falls far below the 18.15-billion-gallon target Congress had originally set and below the 16.55-billion-gallon <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/documents/420f13042.pdf\">requirement for this year</a>. \u201cAdvances in vehicle fuel economy and other economic factors have pushed gasoline consumption far lower than what was expected when Congress passed the Renewable Fuel Standard in 2007,\u201d the EPA said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we are now at the \u2018E10 blend wall.\u2019 \u201d The biggest renewable fuel is corn-based ethanol, which will amount to about 13.8 billion gallons this year and would be limited to 13 billion gallons next year under the proposal. In 2007, Congress set a 15-billion-gallon limit on corn-based ethanol because of concern about using food for fuel. With a record corn crop this year, ethanol is expected to consume about 38 percent of the crop, although distilleries use leftover materials to provide feed to livestock and poultry producers, Dinneen said. \u201cFarmers planted 93 million acres to get that corn crop, in anticipation of a growing fuel market,\u201d Dinneen said. \u201cEPA just took 500 million bushels of demand away from the farmers. That\u2019s going to have a significant impact on corn prices, and corn prices were already falling.\u201d Livestock and poultry industry officials, on a conference call organized by the API, said there wasn\u2019t any more need to set ethanol-volume requirements than there was for setting requirements for turkey output. The EPA also slashed the target production of cellulosic ethanol. The middle of the cellulosic ethanol target range \u2014 about 17 million gallons \u2014 is high enough to make room for the output of one or two of the handful of commercial-scale distilleries set to start up next year. Even with those producers, cellulosic-ethanol output will amount to a drop in the bucket of American motor-fuel consumption. The 2007 legislation mandated that the use of cellulosic ethanol grow gradually until it hit 16 billion gallons in 2022. Gerard called cellulosic ethanol a \u201cphantom fuel,\u201d but Dinneen said companies were \u201cat the cusp\u201d of commercializing cellulosic and that the EPA rules would hurt their ability to get financing. The administration Friday also set a target range for all advanced biofuels of 2 billion to 2.5 billion gallons. Producers of biodiesel, which falls under that category, say they can provide more. On Thursday, 32 senators sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, asking her to set a volume target of at least 1.7 billion gallons for biodiesel alone. \u201cBiodiesel has exceeded RFS targets in each year and is clearly poised to do so again in 2013,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cThe industry has had impressive growth, going far beyond initial expectations just five years ago, and is supporting 62,160 jobs and nearly $17 billion in total economic impact.\u201d Related: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/cellulosic-ethanol-once-the-way-of-the-future-is-off-to-a-delayed-boisterous-start/2013/11/08/a1c41a70-35c7-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Cellulosic ethanol is off to a delayed, boisterous start</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/why-hasnt-cellulosic-ethanol-taken-over-like-it-was-supposed-to/2013/11/08/b25b0d2c-466a-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Why hasn\u2019t cellulosic ethanol taken over the industry?</a> "}], "saliency": []}
{"docId": "885059eead31776c1b0584f9667835fc", "title": "The U.S. may be hitting its ethanol limit. So EPA wants to relax its biofuels goals.", "document": [{"name": "body_par_0", "value": "When it comes to ethanol, the United States may have reached its limit \u2014 at least for now. Back in 2007, Congress passed a law that would require the nation to use more and more ethanol and other biofuels each year. But for reasons of chemistry and economics, those targets are becoming increasingly difficult to fulfill. That helps explain why, on Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency took the unusual step of proposing to cut its biofuels targets for next year. The agency <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/documents/rfs-2014-standards-nprm-11-15-13.pdf\">will require</a> gasoline refiners to use just 15.2 billion gallons of biofuels in 2014 \u2014 down from 16.55 billion gallons this year. The new target is 14 percent lower than the original goal envisioned by Congress. The EPA's move is a victory for gasoline refineries, which have long argued that the original targets were unworkable. And it's a fairly big setback for the biofuels industry, at least for the time being. <strong>Here's the back story:</strong> In 2007, Congress updated its <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40155.pdf\">Renewable Fuel Standard</a>, which set rough targets for the amount of ethanol and other biofuels that had to be blended into the nation's gasoline supply each year. By 2013, that target rose to 16.55 billion gallons \u2014 and it was supposed to <em>keep </em>rising until it hit 36 billion gallons in 2022. There was just one hitch. When Congress passed the law in 2007, lawmakers figured that Americans would keep using more and more gasoline each year, and all that ethanol would make up a small portion of the total. Instead, the opposite happened. Americans started <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/05/graph-of-the-day-americans-buying-more-efficient-cars-polluting-less/\">buying more fuel-efficient cars</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/why-arent-younger-americans-driving-anymore/\">driving less</a>. U.S. gasoline use has actually fallen in recent years. And that created a hassle. Right now, the nation is at the point where much of its gasoline contains about 10 percent ethanol. That, in itself, isn't a problem. Cars and fuel pumps in the United States can easily handle gasoline with 10 percent ethanol or less, a blend known as \"E10.\" But if we started mixing even more ethanol in that gasoline \u2014 say, moving up to 15 percent, or E15 \u2014 it gets trickier. E15 is more corrosive, and it's not deemed suitable for cars built before 2000, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles, or non-road engines (like boats or snowmobiles). For cars built <em>after</em> 2001, the government has declared the fuel safe after extensive testing, but even so, many auto manufacturers <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/30/aaa-e15-gas-harm-cars/1735793/\">have said</a> that their warranties won't cover any damage caused by fueling with E15. For that reason, the 10 percent number is known as the \"blend wall,\" and fuel marketers claim we've just about hit it. If the targets for biofuels keep going up and up each year, it's going to be increasingly difficult to mix ethanol into the gasoline. Blenders and refineries say they'll have to keep buying up <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138383/bio03.pdf\">renewable credits</a> instead to comply with the law \u2014 and that will raise their costs. In theory there are ways the wall could be knocked down. The country could find ways to use more E15. What's more, there are currently about 11 million <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible-fuel_vehicle\">\"flexible-fuel\" vehicles</a> in the United States that can technically handle E85, or fuel that's 85 percent ethanol. The problem? There aren't many fueling stations that offer E85 outside of the Midwest, and regulators aren't sure how quickly these stations will pop up. Oil refiners and blenders say that these stations aren't popping up quickly enough \u2014 and won't anytime soon. Renewable fuels advocates, for their part, claim that the biggest obstacle is actually the oil industry itself, which (they say) <a href=\"http://www.ethanolrfa.org/news/entry/rfa-requests-multi-agency-investigation/\">has hindered the expansion</a> of E15 and E85 fueling infrastructure. <strong>The EPA decides to step in. </strong>So that brings us to the Environmental Protection Agency. On Friday, the EPA proposed<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/documents/rfs-2013-standards-final-rule-8-6-13.pdf\"> </a>to relax the biofuels target for 2014 to 15.21 billion gallons, which amounts to just under 10 percent of the motor fuel expected to be used next year. That will mainly affect corn-based ethanol, which will go from providing 13.8 billion gallons of fuel this year to just 13 billion gallons next year. Advocates of renewable fuels say this is likely to hurt corn farmers, who made planting decisions this year in anticipation of a rising ethanol supply. (Roughly <a href=\"http://southeastfarmpress.com/grains/corn-supply-seems-adequate-fuel-feed-food-and-exports\">38 percent</a> of the U.S. corn crop is used to make ethanol.) Corn prices <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/corn-is-falling-after-epa-decision-2013-11\">fell more than 1 percent</a> after the EPA announced its proposal. The EPA also dealt with the question of \"advanced\" biofuels. When Congress enacted the law in 2007, it declared that a certain portion of biofuels had to come from cellulosic materials or other sources. The idea was to shift the nation's biofuel industry away from crop-based ethanol, so as not to put a strain on the food supply and to address the <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/blogs/environment/2012/03/19/5154/study-finds-e85-corn-ethanol-worse-environment-gas/\">environmental concerns about corn ethanol</a>. But so far, cellulosic ethanol <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bumpy-road-to-wider-biofuel-use/2013/02/01/b4f28736-6beb-11e2-ada0-5ca5fa7ebe79_story.html\">hasn't really materialized in large volumes</a>. The technology is advancing slowly. So, on Friday, the EPA lowered its targets for advanced biofuels to around 2.2 billion gallons (down from 2.75 billion gallons this year). What's more, refineries will have to use roughly 17 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol, made form things like switchgrass, corn cobs, and wood chips. The EPA's proposal will now go through a 50-day comment period. And the debate is likely to be contentious. Oil companies have lobbied to relax the rules considerably \u2014 with some groups even asking Congress to <a href=\"http://www.ogj.com/articles/2013/07/api-launches-fuel-for-thought-campaign-aimed-at-repealing-rfs.html\">repeal the standard altogether</a>. Biofuels producers are pushing back. And the <a href=\"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/renewable-fuels-debate-cutting-through-the-hype\">dueling ad campaigns</a> are getting increasingly ferocious. <strong>Further reading:</strong> \u2014 This <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40155.pdf\">report</a> from the Congressional Research Service on the Renewable Fuels Standard is a nice, thorough primer on the subject. \u2014 My colleague Steven Mufson recently wrote <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/cellulosic-ethanol-once-the-way-of-the-future-is-off-to-a-delayed-boisterous-start/2013/11/08/a1c41a70-35c7-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html?tid=hpModule_a2e19bf4-86a3-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394&hpid=z13\">an excellent in-depth piece</a> on the long, bumpy road to cellulosic ethanol. \u2014 Here's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/ap-investigation-obamas-green-energy-drive-comes-with-an-unadvertised-environmental-cost/2013/11/04/c0ceb0b0-45ad-11e3-95a9-3f15b5618ba8_print.html\">a recent AP investigation</a> on how corn ethanol isn't nearly as environmentally friendly as advertised.

At issue is the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/oms/fuels/renewablefuels/\">2005 Renewable Fuel Standard</a>, a law requiring energy companies to blend an increasing amount of renewable fuel, such as corn-based and cellulosic-based ethanol, into the nation\u2019s motor fuel supply. The law directs that fuel refiners blend in 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022; by that year, EPA <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/420f10007.pdf\">has estimated</a>, this would displace about 7 percent of gasoline and diesel fuel use. But the law \u2014 and EPA, which implements it \u2014 has now run into serious problems. People are <a href=\"http://umtri.umich.edu/what-were-doing/news/gasoline-use-lowest-rate-three-decades\">using less gas</a>, mainly because cars have become more fuel-efficient. And fuel refiners are protesting the requirement, saying they cannot meet targets without breaching a \u201c<a href=\"http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/will_the_ethanol_blend_wall_block_biofuels_growth\">blend wall</a>\u201d beyond which so much renewable fuel is introduced into motor fuels that it puts vehicles at risk. (Some experts, however, contest that is a real risk.) The EPA, which is required to set blend requirements yearly, has a missed a number of deadlines and in November of last year <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-09/pdf/2014-28163.pdf\">punted</a> on issuing any rules for 2014. The agency is in effect stuck in the middle between petroleum and gasoline interests, who <a href=\"http://www.api.org/news-and-media/news/newsitems/2014/nov-2014/api-epa-incapable-of-implementing-the-rfs-time-for-repeal\">want to see</a> the RFS repealed, and the ethanol industry \u2014 which strongly supports it. The lag in rulemaking has spurred two powerful industry groups, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, to sue the agency  to get it to take action. The suit last month has now prompted the EPA to agree in a <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/documents/notice-lodging-consent-decree.pdf\">consent decree</a> to a schedule for finally producing the required regulations. It says it will issue proposed rules for 2015 blend requirements by June 1, and final rules for both 2014 and 2015 by Nov. 30. In addition, EPA says it will also produce 2016 standards by those same 2015 dates. \u201cWe will be back on the statutory timeline,\u201d Christopher Grundler, director of EPA\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, said during a press call Friday. \u201cOur goal is to provide the market with the certainty it needs to continue to grow renewable fuel volumes.\u201d As for why the EPA got off track to begin with, Grundler said that it was largely because the gasoline supply hit the so-called \u201cblend wall\u201d in 2014. But the new agreement does not in any way resolve the difficult issue of how EPA will set volume requirements that balance the competing demands of the petroleum and renewable fuel industries. Furthermore, the 2005 renewable fuels legislation calls for vastly increasing the use of ethanol made from cellulosic materials, which would only make it more difficult for EPA to resolve the \u201cblend wall\u201d problem.
